NOTES : I can&#39;t really remember where I got this recipe.  But I&#39;m blaming it on Uncle Don because as we come in the door on Christmas Day, he hands us something of this nature.  Now he calls them &quot;Rocky Mountain Throw-Downs or Ups&quot; or something like that...anyway, the rhythm of what he calls it is the same.  Now, I may have experienced a moment of elegance and wanted to add this to my collection of recipes so I renamed it Christmas Froth...or I just couldn&#39;t remember the name that Uncle Don called it.  I wonder if I was trying to remember it right after I had one or two...anyway, I&#39;m sure this is due to his influence no matter what!
