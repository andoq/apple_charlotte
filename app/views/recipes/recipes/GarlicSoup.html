Heat a large soup kettle or Dutch oven.  Add the olive oil, onions and garlic.  Saute a couple of minutes being careful not to burn the garlic.  Add the stock, water, potatoes, a little salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, make croutons with bread slices.  Cut into squares.  Pour a little olive oil over them and spread them out on a sheet pan.  Place in a preheated 400F oven and cook until dark golden brown for about 12 minutes, more or less.

Strain the soup through a sieve when it is cooked, keeping the liquid.  Place the solids in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth.  Return the solids to the pan with the liquid and add the milk.  Bring up to temperature and serve with the croutons.
