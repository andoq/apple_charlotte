<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Spray sides of 10&quot; springform pan with cooking spray.  Stir together cracker crumbs and sugar.  Add Grand Marnier to melted butter and pour over crumb mixture, using fork to thoroughly combine.  Pat crust onto bottom and sides of pan, forming a fairly even 1 3/4&quot; side crust.  Set aside.
</li>
<li>
Puree thawed berries in food processor until smooth.  Strain through a fine sieve into small saucepan.  Add 1/4 cup Grand Marnier, sugar, jam and cornstarch.  After cornstarch has dissolved, cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened and begins to boil.  Continue stirring while mixture boils slowly for one minute.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.

Lime Filling:  Squeeze limes and strain juice through fine sieve.  Sprinkle gelatin over lime juice and allow to stand 2 minutes.  Microwave on high for 40 seconds, stir thoroughly and allow to stand 2 minutes until gelatin is completely dissolve.  Stir in 1/3 cup of the sugar and lime zest.  Set aside.  In separate small bowl, beat egg substitute on low speed for about 30 seconds until eggs begin to foam. Gradually sprinkle in remaining 2/3 cup sugar a little at a time, increasing mixer speed to medium as mixture thickens.  Beat 4-5 minutes in all, until eggs are very thick and soft peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into egg mixture and set aside.  At this point, microwave lime/gelatin for 20-30 seconds to warm and liquefy.  Fold about 3/4 cup of whipped egg mixture into lime/gelatin to lighten, then fold lime/gelatin back into egg mixture.

Spoon half the lime filling into graham cracker crust, making edges slightly higher than center of pie.  Reserve about 1/4 cup berry filling for pie surface and pour remaining berry filling into center, leaving 1&quot; border of lime filling around outer edge.  Top with remaining lime filling and smoothe with metal spatula or similar tool.  Drop spoonfuls of reserved berry filling onto pie surface.  Using sweeping circular motions with the tip of a clean toothpick or chopstick, create a bequtiful swirling effect.  Refrigerate 4-6 hours until set.  Garnish with fresh lime slices and berries.  Best if served the same day.
