<li>
1 medium leek, white part only
</li>
<li>
2 packages frozen chopped spinach, 10 oz each
</li>
<li>
drained and squeezed between palms to of
</li>
<li>
hands to remove moisture
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
</li>
<li>
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
</li>
<li>
2 large eggs
</li>
<li>
3/4 cup feta cheese, crumbled
</li>
<li>
1/2 pint cottage cheese, small curd
</li>
<li>
1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, grated
</li>
<li>
1 tablespoon dry bread crumbs
</li>
<li>
1 package filo dough, thawed according to pkg. directions
</li>
<li>
2 cups clarified butter, melted
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet.  When it is hot add the onion and leek and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until lightly browned.  Stir in the spinach and the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil.  Continue to cook, stirring, until the mixture stops steaming.  Stir in the dill, salt and pepper until well blended.  Turn the mixture into a large bowl and refrigerate until cooled.  When ready to proceed, stir in the eggs, cheeses and bread crumbs until very well blended.
</li>
<li>
Lay the stack of filo with the longest side facing you on a large, flat work surface.  Cut the stack into 6 equal strips, cutting lengthwise.  ( ruler helps...cut about 5 1/2&quot; wide x 3 and then cut those strips in half again).
</li>
<li>
Proceed to fill.  Butter each strip with a pastry brush (keep the others covered).  Quickly, place a rounded teaspoon of filling at the bottom of the strip.  Then fold as you would for a flag, a continuous move of right angles, each time making a triangle, folding until you reach the end of the strip.  Place on an ungreased baking sheet.  Continue on the rest of the strips until all the cheese filling is used.  You will have about 48 pieces, more or less.
</li>
<li>
Bake in the top of the oven for 10 minutes. Brush with butter again and continue to bake for 10 more minutes or until golden.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately or cool on wire rack and reheat later.
