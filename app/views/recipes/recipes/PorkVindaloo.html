<h2>Method</h2><ul>

Directions
</li>
<li>
Trim all visible fat off the pork and cut into 1-inch cubes and place in a bowl. Combine coriander, cumin, mustard, and chilies and grind into a fine powder and transfer into a measuring cup. Add turmeric, vinegar, and garlic and mix. Pour the marinade over the pork and rub well. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan over medium/high heat until hot. Add the cinnamon, cloves, and onions, and ginger. Cook until the onions are very soft - do not let them brown - about 5 minutes. Remove pork from the refrigerator and drain, reserving the liquid. Add pork to the onion mixture and cook until the meat is lightly seared. Add paprika, plam sugar, water, salt, and the reserved liquid and bring the contents to a boil. Simmer pork for 1 1/2 hours or until very tender. Serve vindaloo with plain or coconut rice.
