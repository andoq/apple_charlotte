Serving Ideas : Serve with French baquette or crackers.NOTES : This recipe will forever remind me of our good friend, Francis Risdon, who died at a much too young age of cancer.  Everyone loved Francis and she loved us all.  When I think of Francis, I think of two things:  she played flute in the Spokane Symphony Orchestra and she played just like the most melodic of birds; and her wonderful reputation of cooking hords of great food.  There was nothing greater than piling into Francis&#39;s home with a bunch of other musicians to enjoy some of the very best cooking in Spokane...hers!  This so simple and so fabulous.  I&#39;ve always called it &quot;Francis&#39;s Cheeseball&quot;!  It never fails me...neither did she.  Love to her.
