Either slice, paper thin, or peel with a potato peeler the potatoes into the hot fat stirring them occasionally so they will not stick.  This should take a few minutes.  Season and stir in.  Add the French seasoning stirring to cover all the potatoes.  Lower the heat and cook until the potatoes are golden on the underside, about 10 minutes.  When the potatoes are golden, invert a large serving platter on top of the pan and invert the galette onto the platter.  Place in a 200F oven to keep warm.
