<h1>Onion Crackers</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>
2 cups flour
</li>
<li>
1 teaspoon baking powder
</li>
<li>
1 tablespoon sugar
</li>
<li>
2 teaspoons salt
</li>
<li>
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
</li>
<li>
1 large egg, room temperature
</li>
<li>
1/3 cup vegetable oil
</li>
<li>
1 cup finely chopped onions
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons water, if needed
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Measure the dry ingredients into the work bowl of a food processor.  Pulse.  Mix the egg, oil and onion into a large measuring cup (for easy pouring).  Pour the liquid mixture through the feed tube.  If the dough is too crumbly, add water as needed..
</li>
<li>
Process for 20 seconds and then finish kneaking on lightly floured board, adding a bit of flour if needed.  If should feel like a soft mass.
</li>
<li>
Place the bowl in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Place in the refrigerator and allow to relax for 30 minutes.  Have a glass of wine.
</li>
<li>
Preheat the oven to 375F before shaping.
</li>
<li>
Divide the dough into 2 pieces.  Cover one piece with plastic wrap while shaping the first batch of crackers.  Press and roll the dough into a rectangle about the length of the baking sheet.  Roll the dough as thin as possible without tearing it apart.  With the help of the rolling pin, lift and transfer the thin sheet of dough to the baking sheet.  With a rolling pizza cutter  cut the dough into as many crackers as you desire.  Prick each cracker with the tines of a fork.  Repeat with the second piece of dough.  About 60 1&quot; pieces can be cut from the dough (but you can make them any size you wish).
</li>
<li>
Place the baking sheet on the lower shelf of the oven and bak until light golden brown, about 10 minutes (it can take as long as 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the dough).    Cool on a metal rack.
