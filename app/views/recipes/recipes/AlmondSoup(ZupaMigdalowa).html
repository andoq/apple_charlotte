NOTES : This is an absolute must preceding any Christmas Eve dinner at our house.  Everyone loves it...especially John.  I wouldn&#39;t be able to serve Christmas Eve dinner if we didn&#39;t have this according to him.  He&#39;s already started checking on my menu this year...a month before the event to be assured that even though he&#39;s not in Spokane to hound me anymore, when he sits down to Christmas Eve dinner, we wouldn&#39;t be missing anything, now, would we?
