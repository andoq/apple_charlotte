<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Cut fish in 2 inch cubes.  Toss together fish, shrimp, line juice and jalapenos.  Refrigerate for 2 hours.  Place fish bones (if unavailable, clam juice can be substituted for half of the water) in a stockpot with one onion and one garlic (both quartered) and one celery rib.  Cover with water and simmer one hour.  Drain and discard solids.  Reserve stock.
</li>
<li>
Saute bacon until brown.  Reserve.  Saute remaining three oninons, two celery ribs and both peppers (all diced) until tender and golden.  Add garlic, finely minced and saute a minute longer.  Add potatoes, thyme, bay and nutmeg and cover with hot stock.  Add tomatoes and tomato paste (if using).  Cook until potatoes are barely tender, about 15-20 minutes.  Add fish and shrimp along with their marinade.  Simmer another 10-15 minutes until done.  Thin with beer, if needed and adjust heat level to taste.
