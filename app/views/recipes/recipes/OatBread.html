<h1>Oat Bread</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>
1 package active dry yeast
</li>
<li>
1 3/4 cups lukewarm water
</li>
<li>
1 1/2 cups steel cut oats, coarsely ground in food processor
</li>
<li>
2 cups unbleached white bread flour
</li>
<li>
1/2 tablespoon sea salt
</li>
<li>
extra coarse oatmeal for sprinkling
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Place yeast in 3/4 cup of the water and proof for 5 minutes until bubbly.  Place remaining cup water in bowl, add yeast water and oats and quickly mix to make thin, gritty, lump-free batter.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at warm room temperature for about 4 hours.  The mixture should become thick and spongy.
</li>
<li>
Work in the white flour and salt to make a soft, very slightly sticky dough.  It will feel rather more gluey than a white flour dough.  If the dough sticks to your hands or the bowl, add a little more flour.  If there are dry crumbs in the bowl or the dough feels stiff and dry, add a little more water.
</li>
<li>
Turn the dough out on to a work surface and knead thoroughly for 10 minutes.  Cover the dough with a sheet of plastic wrap and leave for 15 minutes.
</li>
<li>
Shape the dough into an oval loaf about 9 inches long and put onto the prepared baking sheet.  Put the sheet into a large plastic bag or cover lightly with a damp dish towel.  Leave to rise until almost doubled in size for 1-2 hours.
</li>
<li>
Twenty minutes before completion of rising (more or less), preheat the oven to 425F.
</li>
<li>
Sprinkle the top of the loaf with a little oat meal.  Then, using kitchen scissors, snip the top in a zig-zag pattern.  Bake for about 35 minutes until the loaf turns a light golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped underneath.  Cool on a wire rack.
</li>
</ul>
