1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar

<li>
1/4 cup red wine
</li>
<li>
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Whisk  the stock and vinegars together.  Add the olive oil a little at a time, whisking.  Add seasonings and taste to correct.
</li>

To roast the red peppers, place raw, unpeeled peppers directly on flame on gas stove or under broiler on electric stove.  Cook and turn until blackened.  Immediately place in bowl with plastic cover  or in paper sack to sweat.  Leave until cool and peel under cold running water.  Cut into strips and place in clean bowl.

Take about 2 tablespoons* (not using all of the viniagrette decreases the calories and fat content of this recipe by about 1/3) and mix with the pepper strips.  Add chopped parsley and serve on crostini.
</li>
<li>
Crostini:  Spray thinly sliced baguette slices with olive oil and bake until crisp in 425F oven, about 10 minutes.  Allow to cool briefly before placing ingredients on top.  This can be used as a base for all kinds of toppings.
