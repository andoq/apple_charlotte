<h2>Method</h2><ul id='method'>

Preheat oven to 375F.

Lightly s/p butterflied loin.  Spread cooled compote all over leaving a 1/2&quot; rim all around.  Roll up and tie with cotton string or floss.
</li>
<li>
Place tied loin in large bowl and drizzle olive oil all over.  Sprinkle herbs, garlic and s/p over loin and roll around to completely cover.  Can be done to this point the day before.  Refrigerate if making later.
</li>
<li>
Heat a large skillet.  Add a little olive oil and when hot, brown loin all around.  Place entire skillet in oven and cook until cooked through 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes.  Temperature on thermometer should read 145-50F.  Take out of oven and place on warmed platter and cover with aluminum foil.

<h2>Notes</h2><div id='notes'><p>
Meanwhile deglaze pan with port and wine and reduce by 1/3.  Add chicken stock and reduce until thickened slightly and tasty (should not taste alcohol), about 10-15 minutes.  Strain sauce.  Place back into pan and whisk in 1-2 tablespoons of &quot;cold&quot; butter.  Taste to correct seasoning.  This is not a gravy, this is a light &quot;moistening&quot; sauce.SOURCE: Apple Charlotte
