<h1>Port Wine Ice Cream</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>
1 cup heavy cream
</li>
<li>
1 cup half and half
</li>
<li>
3/4 cup granulated sugar
</li>
<li>
6 large eggs
</li>
<li>
1 1/2 cups port
</li>
<li>
3 tablespoons grenadine

</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Heat the heavy cream and half and half in a medium sauce pan over medium-high heat.  When hot, add 1/4 cup sugar and stir to dissolve.  Bring to a boil.
</li>
<li>
While the cream is heating, place the eggs and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in the bowl of an electrick mixer fitted with a paddle.  Beat the eggs on medium for 2-2 1/2 minutes.  Scrape down the bowl, then beat on medium until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, 2 1/2-3 minutes.  At this point, the cream should be boiling.  If not, adjust the mixer speed to low and continue to mix until the cream boils.  If this is not done, the eggs will develop undersirable lumps.
</li>
<li>
Pour the boiling cream into the beaten eggs, slowly, and whisk to combine.  REturn this mixture to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the cream reaches a temperature of 185F, 2-4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a stainless steel bowl.  Add the port and grenadine and whisk to combine thoroughly.  Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath for about 10-15 minutes.
</li>
<li>
Freeze in an ice-cream freezer following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions.  Transfer the semifrozen ice cream to a plastic container, securely cover the container, then place in the freezer for several hours before serving.  Serve within 2 days.
