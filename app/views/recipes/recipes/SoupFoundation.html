<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
This is the foundation for making any soup you wish.  This is a terrific and healthy way to use up bits and pieces or leftovers to change one meal into an entirely different and wonderful meal.
</li>
<li>
Depending on the quantity desired,  chop one or two onions, 2-3 carrots, and 2-3 celery or approximately.  This really doesn&#39;t matter, just use what you have and some judgement depending on the amount you want to make.  Heat about 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil in a soup pot and add the vegetables.  Cook until translucent, about 7-8 minutes over medium heat.  Add whatever fresh herbs you like, or have on hand (even dry will do in a pinch).  You can be generous with fresh herbs,  giving your finished dish a wonderful fresh flavor. Cook briefly until fragrant.   Add minced garlic to taste.  Cook briefly, being careful not to burn the garlic.  If you want a little heat, add a few red chile flakes....or not.
</li>
<li>
If you want to add meat, use leftover roast chicken, beef or pork.  Or use any kind of fresh or smoked sausage.  Add to the pan and cook a bit to heat through.    
</li>
<li>
If you prefer to make a &quot;pureed&quot; vegetable soup, add the vegetable instead of the meat at this point in large quantity....i.e., 2-3 pounds of broccoli; cauliflower; squash; whatever you desire.  The above seasonings can be changed in any fashion you want to go nicely with your vegetable.
</li>
<li>
Add enough stock to cover.  
</li>
<li>
If you are making a &quot;meat-style&quot; soup, you may want to also add at this time some additional vegetables to fill out your soup; i.e. zucchini, tomatoes, spinach or any bits and pieces of things you may have.  Cook for about 20 minutes or so (until you are ready for it!).
</li>
<li>
If you are making a &quot;pureed&quot; vegetable soup, cook the vegetables in the stock until soft.  Puree and season to taste.  Sometimes, adding a little cream is a nice touch.
