<h1>Pork Braised in Milk</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>
2 teaspoons unsalted butter
</li>
<li>
2 teaspoons olive oil
</li>
<li>
1 3 pound boneless pork loin
</li>
<li>
2 onions, thinly sliced
</li>
<li>
4 cups whole milk
</li>
<li>
4 bay leaves
</li>
<li>
1 tablespoon + fresh thyme leaves
</li>
<li>
2 cloves garlic, cut in half
</li>
<li>
salt &amp; pepper to taste
</li>
<li>
2 pounds Granny Smith apple, peeled and quartered
</li>
<li>
2-4 tablespoons water
</li>
<li>
sugar, to taste
</li>
<li>
1 large bunch watercress
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Heat roasting pan, add butter and oil and brown pork loin all around.  Remove the pork.  Reduce the heat and add the onions, cooking until golden.  
</li>
<li>
Meanwhile heat the milk with 2 of the bay leaves until small bubbles have formed around the edges.  Cover and keep hot until ready to use. 
</li>
<li>
Mince the garlic and thyme together until combined.  Rub all over the pork and season with s/p.  Return to the pan with the onions.  Remove the bay leaves from the milk and pour the milk over the pork.  Add the remaining 2 bay leaves, cover and bring to a simmer.  Reduce the heat to maintain a slow simmer and cook until the  pork is tender but still slightly pink in the center (145F), about 1 hour.  Turn the pork occasionally to make sure it cooks evenly.
</li>
<li>
Meanwhile, place the apples in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons of water.  Cover, bring to a boil and then lower the heat to simmer.  Cook until the apples are tender but with some texture.  Add water if necessary to keep the apples from sticking.  This will turn into a chunky puree.  Season with sugar, if desired, and keep warm over very low heat.  
</li>
<li>
When the pork is cooked through, transfer to heated platter and cover with foil.  Remove the bay leaves and puree the onions and cooking liquid to a soup consistency.  Correct seasoning and serve as a first course.
</li>
<li>
Cut the pork into thick slices, line a warm platter with watercress, top with pork slices and surround with the apples.  Serve immediately.
