Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter a 9&quot; springform pan.  Cut parchment to fit the bottom of the pan.  Butter the parchment.  Melt the chocolate over a double boiler.

With a mixer, beat the egg whites and salt until foamy.  Gradually beat in the remaining sugar until soft peaks form.  Stir 1/4 of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Add the remaining egg whites and sift the flor over the top.  Gently fold the egg whites and flor into the chocolate, just until smooth.  Pour into prepared pan, smooth the surface and bake for 30-35 minutes, until it just cracks.  Let cool slightly and then unmold the cake and dust with powdered sugar.
