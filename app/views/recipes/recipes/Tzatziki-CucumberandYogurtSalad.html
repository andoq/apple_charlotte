Peel the cucumber and cut it into 1/4 inch cubes.  Place the cubes in a colander.  Sprinkle with the salt and toss to mix well.  Place the colander over a bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 8-10 hours or overnight to drain.

Pat the drained cucumber with paper towels to remove as much liquid as possible.  Turn into a large bowl.  Stir the yogurt into the cucumber, mixing gently until thoroughly blended.  Stir in the vinegar, olive oil, garlic, sugar and pepper.  Blend in the sour cream, then the minced dill.  Taste and add salt, if necessary.
