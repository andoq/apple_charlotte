<h1>Duxelle of Mushrooms Strudel</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>
2 tablespoons olive oil
</li>
<li>
1 large shallot, minced
</li>
<li>
3 cloves garlic, minced
</li>
<li>
4 cups crimini mushrooms, chopped in the food processer
</li>
<li>
1 teaspoon fresh thyme, minced
</li>
<li>
1/2 teaspoon fresh sage, minced
</li>
<li>
salt to taste, remembering that cheese will add more salt
</li>
<li>
pinch red pepper flakes
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons marsala wine
</li>
<li>
1  pound baby spinach
</li>
<li>
4 ounces goat cheese
</li>
<li>
15 sheets phyllo dough
</li>
<li>
1 cube butter, melted
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Place olive oil in saute pan.  Add shallots and cook briefly.  Add garlic and cook briefly.  Add thyme and sage and then mushrooms, salt and chile flakes and cook until liquid has evaporated.  Add marsala.  Add spinach and cook until wilted.  Cool to room temperature.  Add crumbled goat cheese.  Taste to correct seasoning.  
</li>
<li>
Open phyllo and butter a sheet with a pastry brush dipped in the melted butter.  Lay this sheet  on a sheet pan lined with parchment.  Continue to butter each sheet individually, until you have 5 stacked.  Spread 1/3 of the mushroom mixture over the entire surface of the sheet on top, leaving 1&quot; all around.  Carefully roll, jelly-roll fashion, making sure the seam is on the bottom.  Fold the ends over and in (like a package).  Brush with butter.
</li>
<li>
Repeat this two more times until you have three strudels.  Score each strudel with a razor blade scoring diagonally about 1 1/2&quot; apart.  This allows the steam to escape.  Place in a 375F-400F oven for about 20-25 minutes until golden and puffy.  
</li>
<li>
Allow to cool briefly, about 10 minutes or longer, and cut diagonally into  1 1/2&quot; pieces.  Serve with Rosemary &amp; Peppered Plum Sauce.
