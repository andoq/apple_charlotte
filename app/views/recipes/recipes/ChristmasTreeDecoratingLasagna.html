Serving Ideas : Needs only a huge green salad and garlic bread.NOTES : This is a simple and always terrificly colorful Christmas season supper for a group of friends or family.  My mom made this once for a big party she had when I visited her in Washington D.C. many years ago.   I have making it ever since and everyone always loves it...I like it better than your typical lasagna and its lots easier.  Make an outrageous dessert like Tirimisu or Italian Christmas Cake and it will be the hit of the season!!
