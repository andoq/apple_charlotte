<h1>Parmesan Coated Fish with Walnut Romesco Sauce</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Romesco Sauce:
</li>
<li>
3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
</li>
<li>
3 large garlic cloves
</li>
<li>
2 fresh green chilies, halved &amp; seeded
</li>
<li>
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
</li>
<li>
3 ripe plum tomatoes, skins removed
</li>
<li>
salt to taste
</li>
<li>
freshly ground pepper to taste
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</li>
<li>
Fish:
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons flour
</li>
<li>
salt to taste
</li>
<li>
freshly ground pepper
</li>
<li>
1/2 tablespoon finely grated parmesan cheese,
</li>
<li>
preferably Parmigiano-Reggiano
</li>
<li>
1/4 cup milk
</li>
<li>
4 6 oz. thick fish fillets (cod, haddock, monkfish
</li>
<li>
or halibut), skins removed
</li>
<li>
1/4 stick butter
</li>
<li>
1 tablespoon oil
</li>
<li>
flat leaf Italian parsley sprigs, for
</li>
<li>
garnish
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Sauce:
</li>
<li>
1.  Take good solid skillet and heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat.
</li>
<li>
2.  Lightly saute the whole garlic cloves for about 3 minutes or until they feel softened and have turned golden.
</li>
<li>
3.  Then add the chilies and walnuts and continue to cook for another 2 minutes.
</li>
<li>
4.  Put all the above into a food processor, returning the skillet to high heat.
</li>
<li>
5.  When the oil begins to smoke,cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise and place them into the hot pan cut-side-down.  Keep the heat high and cook the tomatoes until they are charred and blackened all over -- this will take about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes on each side.
</li>
<li>
6.  Next, add the tomatoes to the processor blender, turn it on to a low speed and add the rest of the oil in a slow, steady stream.  The sauce will then begin to thicken and assume the consistency of mayonnaise.
</li>
<li>
7.  Add salt and pepper to taste; transfer the sauce to a bowl and add balsamic vinegar.
</li>
<li>
8.  If you are going to serve this later, cover and refrigerate; but bring to room temperature before serving.
</li>
<li>
Fish:
</li>
<li>
1.  Mix the flour, seasoning and cheese together on a plate and pour the milk into a shallow dish.
</li>
<li>
2.  Wipe and dry the fish with paper towels.  
</li>
<li>
3.  Dip the fish into the milk and then into the flour mixture, making sure it&#39;s well coated and that you shake off any surplus.
</li>
<li>
4.  Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet and as soon as its really hot cook the fish for 2-3 minutes on each side, depending on its thickness.  The coating should be golden brown, and as soon as its cooked, remove the fillets carefully with a spatula to warm serving plates.
</li>
<li>
5.  Serve with a little sauce spooned over and garnish with the parsley.
</li>
