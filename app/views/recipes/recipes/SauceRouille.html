<li>
In Cuisinart with metal blade and machine running, mince the garlic by dropping it through the feed tupe.  Add the soaked bread, pimiento, parsley, basil, salt and Tabasco and process the mixture for 1 minute, stopping the machine once to scrape down the slide of the bowl.  With the machine running, drizzle the oil slowly through the feed tube in a tin steady stream.  Process the sauce for 1 minute longer.  Serve the sauce at room temperature.

NOTES : This is actually for Bouillabaisse...but is terrific in other dishes too... Like Vegie Sandwiches on Foccacia Bread.  You have to love garlic to love this!
