Cook, swirling the pan, until the butter turns a nutty brown, 30-60 seconds.  Pur into a large mixing bowl.  Add cream cheese, brown sugar and white sugar.  Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth.  Add egg and vanilla; beat until well incorporated.  Add the reserved dry ingredients and chocolate chips and stir just until combined.
