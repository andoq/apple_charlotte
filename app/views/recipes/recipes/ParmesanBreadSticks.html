Using a sharp thin knife, cut the dough into 1/3&quot; strips.  tAke each strip by its ends and twist until evenly corkscrewed.  Lay the twists of dough on an ungreased baking sheet, arranged so they are just touching each other; this will prvent untwisting.

Set the baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 350F oven and bake until the straws are crisp, puffed and brown, 15-20 minutes.   Remove from the oven, cool for 5 minutes, then cut apart with a sharp knife.  Finish cooling the straws on a rack and then store them in an airtight tin or plastic bag until serving time.  They will stay fresh for about 1 week.
