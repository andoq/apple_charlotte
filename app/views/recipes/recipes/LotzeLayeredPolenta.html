<h1>Lotze Layered Polenta</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>
8 cups chicken broth
</li>
<li>
1 lb. polenta
</li>
<li>
1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese, grated
</li>
<li>
2/3 pesto sauce
</li>
<li>
24 sun-dried tomatoes, coarsely chopped
</li>
<li>
1 cup marinara sauce
</li>
<li>
1 lb. Brie, rind removed
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Generously butter an au gratin dish (13&quot; or 9x13&quot; cassarole pan).
</li>
<li>
Bring chicken stock to a rapid boil in a large saucepan.  Run cornmeal through finger into stock in a thin steady stream, whisking immediately.  Turn heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until polenta starts to shrink from sides of pot...about 20-25 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add Parm.  Stir well.  Polenta should be creamy, but firm.
</li>
<li>
Move quickly so that the polenta does not set up and with a spoon or spatula, layer 2 cups of the polenta into the the cassarole dish.  Top with 1/3 cup of the pesto and helf of the sun-dried tomatoes.  Drizzle 1/2 cup of marinara over entire surface.  Top with another 1 1/2 cups of polenta and layer with the remaining pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and marinara.  Cover with another 1 1/2 cups of polenta.  Do not worry about smoothing the polenta...it will brown with more texture if it is left slightly uneven, with some of the tomato and pesto showing through.  Top with chunks of Brie.  At this point, you may cover the dish with plastic wrap, refrigerate, and hold up to 12 hours.  To serve, bring the dish to room temperature and bake in a 350F oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.  Then  set under broiler until top is golden brwon and crusty.
