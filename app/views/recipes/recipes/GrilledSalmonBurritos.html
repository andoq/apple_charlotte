A former sandlot quarterback from Rockland County, New York, 6-foot-4-inch. Alan Harding, the chef and owner of Brooklyn&#39;s Patois, was inspired by the breakfast burrito that Madden ate at his first tailgate. It met Madden&#39;s two rules for tailgate food: it was a jumble of ingredients, and it was spicy. Harding&#39;s version has his hot-smoked salmon, apples and chipotles. In classic tailgating fashion, he did most of the prep work at home, then finished the dish on the grill before the game. If you&#39;re using an outdoor grill, throw some soaked hardwood chips on the fire and close the lid so that the smoke flavors the fish as it cooks.

TO SERVE: Warm the tortillas on the grill for a few seconds, just until pliable. For each burrito, spread some of the grilled onions on a tortilla and top with a salmon fillet, some of the rice mixture and avocado and 2 heaping tablespoons of chipotle cream. Fold in the bottom, sides and top of the tortilla to enclose the filling and serve.
