<h1>Tuna Maki</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul id='ingredients'>
<li>
14 ounces sushi-grade lean tuna, Cut into 1/3&quot; x 1/3&quot; strips (cover and refrigerate until ready to use)
</li>
<li>
1 English cucumber, Cut into long strips
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
</li>
<li>
6 sheets nori, toasted
</li>
<li>
2 1/2 lbs. sushi rice
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons wasabi paste
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul id='method'>
<li>
pickled ginger
</li>
<li>
                        soy sauce
</li>
<li>
Have ready a bowl with 2 cups water/1 tablespoon rice vinegar for moistening your hands.
</li>
<li>
Place the nori on the bamboo mat and sprinkle a little of the vinegar water on the nori...not too much.  Dampen your hands with the vinegar water and spread some sushi rice on the nori spreading about 1/4&quot; thick and leaving 1/2 inch margins along the long edges.  Make a slight depression at about 1/3 the way from you in the rice, and lay the tuna.  Take a finger full of wasabi and run along the tuna.  Add the cucumber next to the tuna..  With the help of the bamboo mat, roll the maki roll tightly.  Finish with the remaining nori.
</li>
<li>
Cut the rolls into six pieces crosswise.  Serve with ginger and soy sauce.

</ul>
