Soak beans overnight.  The next day cook with carrots, celery and onion....cleaned but left in whole pieces for easy removal.

For dressing:  Warm 6 tablespoons of olive oil in saute pan and add Swiss chard and saute until limp.  Add a bit more oil and add the shallot, garlic and saute until fragrant...about 30 seconds.  Add anchovy and stir for a few seconds until fragrant.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Add reserved beans and stir until hot 2-3 minutes.  
</li>
<li>
Add the fresh herbs and stir until blended.  Add vinegar and stir a few seconds to release the sharp vinegar fumes.  Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper.  Add more oil for correct &quot;mouth feel&quot; if necessary.  Refrigerate and let cool to allow the flavors to develop.    Serve at room temperature.
