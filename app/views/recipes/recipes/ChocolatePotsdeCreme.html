<h1>Chocolate Pots de Creme</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

4 cups heavy cream

<li>
1 cup milk
</li>
<li>
12 egg yolks
</li>
<li>
1 cup superfine sugar

1/4 cup dark rum, Kahlua, Grand Marnier or Cognac

<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Preheat oven to 300F.  Move oven rack to middle of oven.
</li>
<li>
Place chocolate in large bowl.
</li>
<li>
Heat cream and milk over medium hight heat until bubbles around the edges, just before boiling.  Pour over chocolate.  Allow to sit for 30 seconds and then stir until smooth.
</li>
<li>
Whisk to beat the egg yolks together.  Gradually whisk in sugar until smooth and combined.  Whisk in booze and vanilla.  Gradually whisk the chocolate mixture into the egg yolks until combined.
</li>
<li>
Strain the custard mix and divide the custard between 12 custard cups or ramekins.  Cover the baking pan with aluminum foil, piercing it in several places to allow the steam to escape.
</li>
<li>
Bake for about 30 minutes or until the pots de creme appear solid but the custard jiggles slightly when shaken.  It is perfect when it is soft but not a liquid.  They will firm up as they cool.

Transfer to wire rack and let cool to room temperature.  Cover each cup with plastic wrap and cool in refrigerator.
