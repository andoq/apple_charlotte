Puree 2/3 of raspberries in a food processor and strain to remove the seeds.  You should end up with 6-8 tablespoons.  The puree will be very thick.  Warm the milk with the sugar, flour  until the sugar is dissolved.  Whisk the eggs separately.  Whisk in about half  of the milk mixture into the eggs to temper and then pour back into the remaining milk mixture..  Return to the pan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard coats the back of the spoon.  Remove from the heat and strain into a bowl.  Add the raspberry puree to taste.  Add the vanilla and chill.  Freeze acording to directions.
