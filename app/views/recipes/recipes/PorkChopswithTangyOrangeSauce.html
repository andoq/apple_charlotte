<h1>Pork Chops with Tangy Orange Sauce</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>
8 1 1/4- 1 1/2&quot; loin pork chops
</li>
<li>
olive oil
</li>
<li>
Sauce:
</li>
<li>
1 medium onion, finely chopped
</li>
<li>
1 3/4 cups chicken stock
</li>
<li>
1 1/4 fresh orange juice
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</li>
<li>
2 tablespoons orange marmalade
</li>
<li>
2 teaspoons cornstarch, dissolved in 2 tablespoons cold water
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul>
<li>
Rub chops with herb rub and marinate and allow to sit for up to 2 hours at room temperature.  If doing the night before, refrigerate and take out allowing chops to come to room temperature before cooking.
</li>
<li>
In a large skillet, heat the oil and sear the chops (a gentle hissing sound will be heard) 1-2 minutes on one side (until brown around the edges) and then turn over and sear 1 minute more.  Reduce the heat (still sizzling) and cook 3-4 minutes.  Turn the meat over and cook another 3-4 minutes.  Should be firm but not hard when pressed with a finger or temperature should measure 145-150F.  Remove from heat and place on warm platter, cover with foil and allow to rest while you make the sauce (5 minutes or so).
</li>
<li>
Sauce:  Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from cooking pan.  Saute the onion over the heat, covered, for 3 minutes, stirring often.  Stir in remaining ingredients, deglazing the pan in the process.  Boil and reduce to about 2 1/2 cups.  Whisk in the cornstarch &quot;slurry&quot; just before serving.
