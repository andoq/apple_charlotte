<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul id='ingredients'>
<li>
Cookie Crust:
</li>
<li>
1 cup all purpose flour
</li>
<li>
1/4 teaspoon sugar
</li>
<li>
1 teaspoon lemon zest, grated
</li>
<li>
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and chilled
</li>
<li>
1 large egg yolk, lightly beaten
</li>
<li>
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
</li>
<li>
Filling:
</li>
<li>
5 8 oz. pkg cream cheese, softened
</li>
<li>
1 3/4 cups sugar
</li>
<li>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
</li>
<li>
5 large eggs
</li>
<li>
2 large egg yolks
</li>
<li>
1/2 cup sour cream
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2><ul id='method'>
<li>
Preheat oven to 375F.
</li>
<li>
Crust:  Combine the flour, sugar and lemon zest.  Using a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture is crumbly.  Using a fork, stir in the egg yolk and vanilla until all the dough is moistened.
</li>
<li>
Pat one third of the crust over the bottom of a 9&quot; springform pan with it sides removed.  Bake for about 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool.  Grease the sides of the springform pan and attach to the bottom.  Pat the remaining two thirds of the crust around the sides, coming up to a height of about 2&quot;.
</li>
<li>
Increase the oven temperature to 475F.  In a large mixing bowl at medium speed, beat together the cream cheese, sugar, and salt until creamy.  Add the vanilla.  Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the sour cream and mix well.  Pour the mixture into the prepared crust.
</li>
<li>
Bake for 10 minutes.  Watch the top of the cake to avoid overbrowning.  Reduce the oven temperature to 200F and bake for an additional 60 minutes.
</li>
<li>
Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.  While the cake is still warm, gently run a thin-bladed knife around the inside edges of the pan to loosen the sides of the cake.  When completely cool, carefully remove the sides of the pan.  Chill for a least 2 hours before serving.
