 Braised Thai Chicken Legs on the Grill

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 teaspoons ground turmeric
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon cayeene pepper
- 2 teaspoons Kosher salt
- 12 whole skin-on chicken legs, with thighs attached
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 2 cups green onions, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons garlic, minced
- 4 teaspoons fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons Thai green curry paste
- 5-6 cups chicken stock
- 1/4 cup fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- Kosher salt
- cilantro, if desired for garnish


METHOD:

Rub:
Mix rub ingredients together and rug all over chicken legs.  Cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

Sauce:
Meanwhile, heat a large heavy pot, large enough to hold the legs, heat the oil.  Add the green onions and stir for 1 minute.  Add lemongrass and stir for 1 minute.  Add the garlic and ginger and stir another minute.  Stir in the curry paste, coating the vegetables.  Add the stock, fish sauce and sugar and bring to a boil.  Take from the heat.  

Turn on the grill, heating until hot with the lid down.  Open the lid and spray the rack.  Turn down the heat to medium and sear the legs until browned on both sides (cooking over direct heat).  Place the pot over the flame as you brown the chicken, keeping it hot.  (This can be done on an outside or inside burner, as well).   As the chicken browns, add to the pot with the sauce, carefully pushing the legs under the liquid.  After all the legs are browned and added to the pot, place the pot over the "cool zone" or indirect fire (fire remains on, on both sides or at the back of the grill, depending on which way your flame runs).  Cover the pot and close the lid of the grill.  Braise over indirect heat until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes.  Transfer the chicken to a warm tray.  

Pour the braising liquid into a gravy separator or a large glass measuring cup, allowing the fat to come to the top.  Pour liquid out of the gravy separator, leaving the fat behind; or, skim the fat off from the top of the liquid in the large measuring cup. 

Glaze:
Turn up the grill again for direct grilling.  Strain enough of the braising liquid to equal 2 cups liquid.  Place in a small saucepan and reduce to about 1/2-3/4 cup glaze.  Return the strained solids to the braising liquid.

Brush the glaze over one side of each chicken leg and grill glaze side down, 2-3 minutes over medium direct heat, being careful not to burn.  Meanwhile brush the other side of the legs with the glaze and then turn over and grill briefly.  

Reheat the braising liquid.  Serve the one leg per person with jasmine rice, spooning some of the braising liquid over.  Garnish with cilantro if desired.

15th Century Lasagna!

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 recipe Char's Fresh Pasta
- 1 recipe Italian Spinach with Raisins & Pinenuts
- 2 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, grated
- 1 cup Parmesan Reggiano, grated finely
- 2 cups fresh bread crumbs, day old is fine
- 1/4 teaspoon salt


METHOD:

Make the pasta and set aside to rest under a bowl.

Make the Ricotta-Parm Filling.  Set aside.

Make the Italian Spinach with Raisins & Pinenuts. 

Grate the mozzarella and the Parmesan cheeses.

Heat the 1/4 cup olive oil in a saute pan.  Add the bread crumbs, mix in oil, add 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Turn off heat.

Choose a large rectangular baking pan (approximately 9"x13").  Oil the bottom of the pan.  Begin to roll out pasta, 1/4 of the dough at a time,  in a pasta maker to a "5" thickness (as designated on the pasta maker).  When you have completed rolling out the first quarter, it will be very long.  Cut it to fit across the bottom of the pan.  You will need two of them on the bottom.  

Top this first layer of pasta with half of the spinach mixture.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the Parmesan over this mixture.  Continue to roll out more pasta.  Lay the pasta down on top of the spinach mixture.  Top this layer with the ricotta filling.  Top this with half of the mozzarella cheese.  Repeat these two layers with more rolled out pasta.  Finish with the last of the ricotta, topping with the last of the mozzarella.  Finish this last layer with the bread crumb mixture.

Place in 375F preheated oven.  Bake about 45-50 minutes until bubbly and puffy.  Remove from oven and allow to set for about 10 minutes before cutting.

A Great Biscuit

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 cups AP flour
- 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 4 tablespoons shortening, cut into pieces
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 3/4 cup buttermilk
- melted butter


METHOD:

Preheat oven to 400F.

Blend together in a food processor the dry ingredients.

Add shortening and butter and pulse until mixture resembles small bits.

Shake the buttermilk and pour over mixture.  Pulse just until the mixture comes together slightly (will look crumbly).  Pour out of the processor and knead dough slightly on lightly floured board 3-4 times.

Pat the dough to 1 inch.  Using a 2" round cutter, cut out biscuits.  Place on parchment lined sheet pan, placing them about 2" apart.  Lightly press together the scraps and cut a few more biscuits.

Brush a little melted butter on top of each biscuit, taking care to have it stay on top and not drizzle down the sides (this will keep the biscuits from rising).

Transfer the biscuits to the oven and increase the temperature to 425F.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.  Cool on a rack for 2 minutes and serve warm.

Apple Charlotte Caesar Dressing

INGREDIENTS:

- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon grainy mustard
- 2 lemons juice
- 3 cloves garlic, or more to taste
- 1 tin (2 oz) anchovies, oil drained
- 1-1 1/2 cups canola oil, more or less
- 1 cup olive oil, more or less
- salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 head or 2 hearts romaine, cut into large chunks
- 1 1/2 cups parmesan cheese
- 3 cups cubed sour dough bread
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced thin
- 1/2 cube butter
- 1/2 cup olive oil


METHOD:

Place everything up to the oil in a food processor.  Blend well.

Begin to add the oil through the tiny hole in the feed tube (as you would with mayo).  Only add about 2 cups totally and then taste.  Add up to about 3 cups oil all together, emulsifying the mixture as you run the machine the entire time.  This will remain emulsified in the refrigerator until ready for use.  Excellent as a marinating mixture, as well!

Croutons:  Heat saute pan.  Add butter and oil.  Saute garlic briefly.  Add bread cubes and coat with butter and oil.  Saute gently over medium low heat until crispy and crunchy but not hard.  Hide these until you are ready to place them in the salad as they have a way of disappearing before needed!!!!

Putting the Salad together:  Pour a good amount of dressing (1 cup or so) into the bowl.  Add the romaine and parmesan.  Mix lightly.  Taste for correct amount of dressing.  Add croutons (delicious if still a little warm); mix again gently.  Add fresh ground pepper and serve.  

I save the leftover dressing in a quart jar.  Great to have around!

NOTES : WENTE VINEYARDS HERMAN WENTE RESERVE CHARDONNAY1995
What an opportunity to participate in "Le Grande Finale" and develop a dessert suited to my catering company name...Apple Charlotte Cooking & Catering Co.!  I loved working with Wente's 1995 "Herman".  This dessert is based on the classic French Apple Charlotte with a twist:  use of croissants instead of bread for a flakey, buttery mold that holds the five-spice infused apple filling, the addition of walnuts and served with a light chardonnay sabayon, all in an effort to pair more favorably with the chardonnay.  Makes 8 servings.

- Biga:
- 2 cups flour, bread or all purpose
- 1 1/3 cups warm water
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- Dough:
- Biga from above
- 1 1/4 cups water

Apple Charlotte Focaccia

INGREDIENTS:

- Sponge:
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 cups warm water
- 2 cups unbleached flour
- Dough:
- 1 cup water, room temperature
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- sponge, above
- 5 cups unbleached flour or bread flour, Add more if needed
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- Topping:
- 4 tablespoons (approximately) extra virgin olive oil
- Other toppings as desired:
- rosemary, sage, minced
- fennel or anise seeds
- dried chile peppers,
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt


METHOD:

Sponge:  Mix yeast, flour and water for about 1 minute in a mixer or by hand.  Allow to sit at least 6 hours or overnight, covered.

Dough:  Add the water, wine, and olive oil to the sponge.  Mix with electric mixer for about 2 minutes.  Add salt.  Change to dough hook.  Add remaining flour making the dough somewhat stiff but still slightly slack, mixing another 2-4 minutes until all the flour is mixed in.

I

Shaping and second rise:  The dough should be soft, full of air bubbles, and stretch easily.  Press it into a lightly oiled 10 1/2 x 15 1/2 inch pan, dimple it well with your fingertips or knuckles, cover with a towel and let rise until puffy and doubled, about 45 minutes.

Baking:  At least 30 minutes before you plan to bake, preheat the oven to 450Fdegrees with a baking stone inside, if you have one.  Once again dimple the top of the dough with your fingertips and drizzle olive oil so it pools in the little indentations, and sprinkle with the salt.  Place the focaccia pan directly on the stone and immediately reduce the temperature to 425F degrees, spraying the oven walls and floor with cold water from a spritzxer bottle 3 times in the first 10 minutes.  Bake the focaccia for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden.  Immediately remove from the pan and let cool on a rack.  If using for sandwiches, sprinkle the warm focaccia with olive oil right after removing from ove.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

NOTES:

NOTES : This is fabulous and very easy.  Grill vegetables including eggplant, onions and tomatoes, make Sauce Rouille or Aioli and make the most outrageous Vegie Sandwiches using this bread you will ever taste!  This bread is great with almost any pasta or Italian dish and easy summer dinners are heaven when this bread is served with a great salad and a hearty red wine.  Enjoy!!!

Apple Sausage Dressing

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 lbs. gound pork sausage
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
- 1/2 cup brandy
- 14 cups 1/4" day old French bread, (about 2 loaves)
- 10 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 cups green apples, chopped, peeled
- 1 1/4 cups onion, minced
- 1 cup celery, minced
- 3/4 cup fresh parsley, minced
- 1 tablespoon ground sage
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon salt
- freshly gound pepper to taste


METHOD:

Mix together sausage, thyme, ground nutmeg and brandy.  Cover and chill overnight.

Preheat oven to 300 F. degrees and spread French bread to dry.  Bake until brown and dry about 30 minutes stirring frequently.  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet.  Add sausage and cook until no longer pink for about 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently to break up lumps.  Add sausage to bread using slotted spoon.  Discard fat.

Melt remaining butter in skillet over low heat.  Add apple, onion and cerery and cook, until vegetables begin to soften, 5-7 minutes.  Stir in parsley and cook 2-3 minutes more.  Add mixture to bread and toss gently.  Blend in remaining ingredients.  Taste and adjust seasoning.  Add more brandy as needed for desired moistness.  Cool completely.  Refrigerate before stuffing bird.  Stuffing that won't fit into turkey may be placed in a cassarole and baked 1 hour.  This works well in a 12-16# turkey.

NOTES:

Serving Ideas : Favorite Thanksgiving StuffingNOTES : My mom, Betty Gerard, always made the best sausage stuffing all the years I was growing up.  I guess we just can't get away from those familiar smells and wonderful traditions.  This is very similar to hers, I've only added brandy (she used sherry which is also wonderful).  And I soak up the brandy in the sausage overnight.  Also a touch of apples adds even more moistness.  Delicious....when I'm really ambitious and have the time I make my own French bread for bread cubes.

Asparagus & Potato Tart

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Ingredients
1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
Sea salt
1 pound asparagus spears, woody ends removed
8 ounces filo pastry
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 cup freshly grated jack cheese
3 large organic or free-range eggs
1 (8-ounce) container heavy cream
1/4 whole fresh nutmeg
Freshly ground black pepper
Directions
Put your potatoes into a pan of salted boiling water and cook for 15 minutes. Meanwhile blanch your asparagus in a separate pan of salted boiling water for 4 minutes, and drain in a colander.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Get an ovenproof dish - I've used many different shapes and sizes. Layer the sheets of filo pastry in the dish, brushing them with melted butter as you go and letting about 1-inch hang over the edge. You want to get the pastry about 5 layers thick. Put a clean, damp kitchen towel over the top and put aside.

When the potatoes are done, mash them with the cheeses. In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs and cream and stir into your cheesy mashed potato. Grate in the nutmeg, season well with pepper and mix together. Spread the mashed potato over the filo pastry, then bring up the sides of the filo and scrunch them together to form a rim. Take your blanched asparagus and line them up across the filling, making sure you cover it all. Brush all over with the remaining melted butter and pop into the preheated oven for around 20 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Serve just as you would a quiche for a quick lunch or supper, with a salad.SOURCE: Adapted from Jamie Oliver

Asparagus Soup

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 lbs. green asparagus
- 6 cups vegetable stock, or light chix stock or water
- bouquet garni
- 2 white onions
- 1 leek
- 2 red potatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- parsley
- creme fraiche


METHOD:

Cut or snap off the rough, rooty ends of the asparagus and simmer the ends in the stock with the bouquet garni for 30 minutes or so.

In a soup pot, saute the onions, leek and potatoes, peeled and diced, in the olive oil and a little water.  When the vegetables are very soft, strain the stock into the pot and bring to a simmer.

Chop the asparagus roughly, reserving the tips to garnish, and add the rest of the chopped asparagus to the soup pot.  Let the soup simmer for about 5 minutes until the asparagus is just tender.  Do not overcook, or you will lose freshness and color.

Puree the soup in a blender using mostly asparagus and a little stock and pass through a fine sieve into a bowl.    Setting the soup in the bowl into a larger bowl of ice water to cool rapidly will help keep a nice color.  The soup should be a dense but smooth liquid.  Thin with stock as  needed to make a soup consistency.  

Cut the asparagus tips in helf lenthwise and blanch for about 1-2 minutes.  Serve the soup chilled or reheated to just below a boil, garnished with the asparagus tips, chopped parsley and creme fraiche.

Babka Wielkanocna

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 1/4 cups milk, lukewarm
- 2 packages yeast
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 12 large egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon almond extract
- 3/4 lbs. +2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons orange peel, finely grated
- 1 tablespoon lemon peel, finely grated
- 1/2 cup chopped almonds
- 1/3 cup raisins, yellow
- blanched almonds halves
- fine dry breadcrumbs


METHOD:

Pour the lukewarm milk into a small bowl and sprinkle it with the yeast and 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar.  Let the mixture stand for 2-3 minutes.  Stir to dissolve the yeast completely.  Set the bowl aside in a warm place for about 10 minutes or until the mixture almost doubles in volume.

Place 6 cups of the flour, the remaining sugar and the salt in a deep mixing bowl in a heavy duty mixer.  Pour in the yeast mixture and egg yolks and flavorings and gradually mix  the flour into the liquid ingredients.  Continue to mix slowly until well mixed, then beat in 3/4 pound of the butter a tablespoon at a time.  The dough should be firm enough to gather into a medium soft ball.  If needed, add up to 1/2 cup more flour, adding a bit at a time.

Change the paddle beater to a kneading hook and knead for about 20 minutes or until the dough is very smooth, glossy and elastic.  If kneading by hand this will take about 40 minutes.

Shape the dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl.  Put plastic wrap over the bowl and set aside in a draft-free place until doubles in volume, about 1 hour.

With a pastry brush, spread the last 2 tablespoons of butter in a 2-quart Gugelhupf pan or a angel food cake pan or mold.  Sprinkle with flour and tap out excess.

Punch the dough down and knead in raisins and citrus peels. Place the dough evenly into the pan.  Allow the dough to rise again until doubled or about 1 hour or until the dough has risen almost to the top of the mold.

Preheat the oven to 375F.  Bake the brad in the middle of the oven for about 40 minutes or until it is golden brown.  Turn the bread out onto a cake rack and let it cool briefly at room temp.  You can top with a light icing of powdered sugar, water and lemon juice, if desired.

Baby Back Spareribs with Chipotle & Peanut Sauce

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 slab pork spareribs weighing 3-4 pounds
- 1 1/2 cups red chile sauce (in Mexican recipe file)
- 1/2 cup tomato puree or pureed canned tomatoes
- 4 chipotles
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar or honey
- 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup Spanish peanuts, roasted
- cilantro, chopped for garnish


METHOD:

Leave the ribs whole on the slab for cooking.

Preheat the oven to 375.  Place the meat in the pan in one layer.  Salt and pepper and cover to steam and bake for 45 minutes.

Meanwhile prepare the sauce by combining the red chili sauce, tomato puree, chipotles, sugar and vinegar in a blender.  Blend at a low to medium speed until the chipotles are incorporated.  Do not salt.

At the end of the 45 minutes, remove the spareribs from the oven and raise the heat to 400F for glazing them.  Take the ribs out of the pan with a slotted spoon, transfer them a cutting board and cut into individual ribs.  Place in large bowl and pour the sauce over, reserving 1/2 cup.  Discard the fat in the baking pan, put the ribs back in, tossing them a little to coat completely with the sauce, and bake at 400F for about 20 minutes more.

Remove the meat to a large covered bowl or pan and cover allowing a few moments to rest.  Degrease the baking juices in the pan and add the reserved sauce.  Stirring over low heat, scrape up the cooked bits that cling to the bottom of the pan.  If the sauce is not thick enough to coat the ribs, turn up the heat and boil for a few minutes (not usually necessary).  Grind the peanuts coarsly in processor  and stir them into the sauce.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Pour the sauce over the ribs and transfer them to a serving platter.  Garnish with a liberal sprinkling of cilantro.

Baklava

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 1/3 cups walnut pieces, toasted
- 1 1/3 cups blanched almonds, toasted
- 1/3 cup dry unflavored bread crumbs
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1 pound(box) phyllo dough, thawed
- butter, clarified, melted
- 16 whole cloves
- Syrup:
- 2 cups sugar
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1 3" cinnamon stick
- 3 whole cloves
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1 tablespoon brandy


METHOD:

Chop nuts finely in food processor, being careful not to pulverize them.  Mix the nuts, crumbs and ground cinnamon until well blended.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter the bottom and sides of a 13x9" glass baking dish.  Remove the phyllo from the package to a work surface and smooth out the stack of sheets.  With a pizza cutter cut the phyllo in half to make two stacks of 12 x 8 1/2" sheets.  

Place 1 piece of phyllo in the bottom of the pan.  Brush with the melted butter.  (Alternate sheets so that every other one, more or less, reaches the opposite ends of the pan).  Repeat this procedure to make 21 layers of phyllo, but leave the final sheet dry.  Sprinkle evenly with about 3/4 cup of the nut mixture.  Add 4 more sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter before adding another, except for the top sheet, which should be left dry.  Sprinkle with an additional 3/4 cup of the nut mixture.  Repeat this procedure three more times, ending with a layer of nuts.  Add the remaining sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter before adding another.  Brush the top generously with butter.

With a long, sharp knife, cut the layers into lengthwise thirds.  Then cut into diamond shapes ending these cuts just short of the lengthwise cuts and sides of the pan.

With a short spatula, go around all four sides of the pan, tucking the layers of dough down so that the edges are reasonably smooth.  Stick a clove into the center of each diamond shape.  Bake for about 1 hour, or until golden brown.  Remove the baklava from the oven and set on a wire rack to cool completely.  

While the baklava is cooling, make the syrup by combining the ingredients in a medium saucepan.

Bring to a boil, sitrring constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugar is dissolved.  Boil slowly for about 5 minutes.  Add the honey and continue  to boil slowly for 5 minutes longer.  Remove from the heat and stir in the brandy.  Set aside to cool to lukewarm.  Pour the luckwarm syrup over the cooled baklava.  Cover lightly and set aside at room temperature for several hours or overnight.  Finish cutting the baklava into diamonds before serving.

Basic Chile Sauce

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon oregano
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1/2 cup powdered red chiles
- 2 1/2 cups water
- 1 teaspoon salt


METHOD:

Heat the oil over medium heat in a 1-2 quart saucepan.  Add the onion and garlic and saute gently for about 5 mminutes or until the onion is wilted, translucent and turning yellow.  Stir in the oregano, cumin and flour and cook, stirring constantly, until this mixture (which is like a roux) bubbles up and begins to turn a very light brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove pan from heat.

IN a separate bowl, mix the powdered chilies and water until they are smoothly blended.  Pour them into the flour-onion paste, stirring t prevent lumbs with a wire whisk.  Return the pan to medium heat and bring the sauce to the boiling point.  Stir from time to time until you begin to see bubbles.  (Since red chilies scorch quite easily, how much you have to stir this sauce depends on the quality of your cookware.  Stir constantly and watch carefully the first time out.)  When the sauce just begins to show signs of active boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer, covered for 2-3 minutes more.  Make sure to stir a few times, reaching thoroughly around the bottom and sides of the pan to catch any lumps beginning to form.  When the sauce is thickened, smooth and no longer raw-tasting, add the salt, beginning with the smaller amount.  Remove from heat and set aside until needed.

The finished sauce should be thick enough to nap a smoon heavily; it should have a deep, pungent taste of chili without unpleasant umstiness  or unpalatable hotness.  If it is too bitter or crude for your taste, try other brands of powdered chilies.  However, this sauce should not be expected to stand alone.  Even if somewhat bitter or swee t the real test for "chile colorado" is to marry it with tortillas, so plan as soon as possible to make a batch of enchiladas with your sauce.

Bechamel or White Sauce

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 cups milk
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 tablespoons AP flour
- nutmeg
- onion with cloves
- garlic clove
- bay leaf


METHOD:

Heat milk in saucepan with onion "clouted" with cloves, garlic clove and bay leaf.  Do not let it boil.

In another non-reactive pan melt the butter and when it bubbles add the flour all at once, stirring constantly with a whisk.  Let the mixture cook about 3-5 minutes until it smells like a cooked biscuit.  Remove the pan from the heat and pour in the hot milk, stirring the entire time (remove the onion, garlic clove and bay leaf before pouring into the flour mixture).  Bring it to a boil while you stir the mixture and then lower the heat until it is thick and glossy.

You can make the sauce thicker or thinner by adding more less of the liquid or solid ingredients.  If the sauce is too thick, add a little hot milk and mix well.  If it is too thin, cook it longer over slow heat, being careful not to let it scorch.

Begger's Purses

INGREDIENTS:

- Crepes:
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 4 eggs
- 1 1/8 cups pastry or A.P. flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup clarified butter (1 stick)
- Filling:
- 48 chives
- 1 1/4 beluga caviar, chilled
- 1 cup creme fraiche
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted


METHOD:

1.  Combine milk, eggs, pastry flour and salt; whisk and then pour through a fine mesh sieve into another bowl.  Just before you cook the crepes, add 1 tablespoon of the clarified butter to the batter and stir it in well.
2.  Heat a crepe pan over medium-high heat until very hot.  Lower the heat to medium.  Brush the pan with a little of the melted butter and when it sizzles, pour in 2 tablespoons of batter.  Swirl the pan to form a crepe about 4 1/2" in diameter.  Cook just until the first side is set (do not brown), about 45 seconds to 1 minute, then turn the crepe and cook on the other side for 5 seconds.  The crepes should be as thin as possible, with no holes.  Remove the crepe from the pan and repeat the process, brushing the pan with butter as needed.  Stack the cooked crepes as they are done, and when you have used up the batter (about 48 crepes), wrap them tightly in plastic wrap to keep them from drying out.
3.  Bring a saucepan of water to a boil.  Using tongs, dip a bunch of 12 chives in the boiling water and blanch for 10 seconds.  Repeat with the remaining chives, placing on paper towels to dry.
4.  Lay several crepes out on a piece of cooking parchment (no more than 12 at a time).  Place 1 teaspoon of caviar in the center of each crepe, and top it with 1/3 teaspoon of creme fraiche.  Pull the edges of the crepe up around the filling, making small pleats to create a ruffle at the top.  Holding the ruffled top with one hand, carefully tie a single chive around the neck and make a double knot to hold it securely.  Snip off any excess length of chive, and repeat with the remaining crepes and filling. 
5.  Brush the purses with the melted butter and serve them at room temp, while the caviar is still cold.

Black Forest Cherry Torte

INGREDIENTS:

- Chocolate Spongecake:
- 8 large eggs, separated
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 6 tablespoons ground walnuts
- 1/2 vanilla bean, scraped contents
- 3 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate
- 6 tablespoons butter, melted, cooled to lukewarm
- 1/2 cup flour mixed with
- 1 1/8 cups cake crumbs
- Filling:
- 1 poundjar Morello cherries with juice (15 oz
- fruit)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 heaping teaspoons cornstarch
- 3 1/4 cups cream
- 1/4 cup kirsch mixed with 3 tablespoons sugar
- syrup
- chocolate curls and confectioners' sugar


METHOD:

Spongecake:

Lightly grease the base of a springform pan and line with parchment paper; don't grease the sides.  Preheat the oven to 375.

Put the egg yolks, about a quarter of the sugar and the ground nuts into a bowl and mix.  Add the scraped contents of the vanilla bean.

Whisk the egg yolk until frothy (this can be done with a mixer).  Beat until the volume has at least doubled.  

Melt the chocolate over hot water and stir it into the mixture while lukewarm.

Continue to shisk until the chocolate is blended completely into the mixture.  Then stir in the lukewarm melted butter.

Whip the egg whites into soft peaks with the rest of the sugar.  (The meringue should be airy and light, yet somewhat creamy, so that it binds well with the egg yolk and butter batter and the flour mixture in the final phase;  this is achieved by whipping the sugar and egg whites together from the start of the egg white whipping process.)

Stir in a tird of the whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture, using a circular motion.

Add the remainder of the whipped egg whites, trickle in the flour and bread crumb mixture, and fold in.

Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the top with a dough scraper.

Filling:

Drain the cherries, reserving the juice.  Bring 1 cup of the juice to a boil with about one third of the sugar and the cinnamon.  Remove the cinnamon stick.  Mix the cornstarch with a little cold water, add the juice and cook until thick.  Set aside 16 cherries for decoration.  Add the remainder to the thickened juice and stir in gently, being careful not to crush the fruit.  Bring to a boil again and then remove from the heat.  Allow to cool.

Whip the cream with the remaining sugar until stiff.  Cut the cake into thirds.  Spread the bottom layer with the shipped cream, then pipe 4 large rings of whipped cream on top.  Fill the gaps between the rings with the cherry filling.  Place the second layer of the spongecake on top, press down and moisten with the kirsch and sugar syrup.  Make the rings again and fill with cherry filling.  Place the last layer on top.  

Spread a layer of cream on top and and sprinkle with kirsch and sugar syrup.  Spread cream around the sides.  Cover the top with chocolate curls.  Pipe cream rosettes around the edge and decorate with cherries.  Dust the center of the cake with confectioners' sugar.

If necessary, add more of the milk mixture so that the dough holds together easily in a ball.  (Additional milk may be added if necessary).  Now lightly press dough together into a rough ball.  The dough will be extremely soft.

Place dish with fruit mixture into oven.  Bake for 10 minutes and then toss fruit with a large spoon.  Meanwhile, roll out dough to a size smaller than the baking dish.  Cut into rounds, squares, or triangles.  When fruit has cooked for a total of 15 minutes, remove from oven.  Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees.  Top fruit wiht dough shapes.  Sprinkle dough with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar.

Return dish to oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until dough is browned and fruit is bubbly and tender.  Allow to cool for 30 minutes before serving with heavy cream or vanilla ice cream.

Bougatsa

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 cups milk
- 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1/2 cup fine semolina
- 3/4 cup clarified butter, or 1 1/2 sticks
- 1/2 lb. phyllo dough
- ground cinnamon, to taste, for sprinkling
- confectioners' sugar, to taste, for sprinkling


METHOD:

Preheat oven to 350F.  In the top of a double boiler over simmering water, combine the milk, sugar, eggs and semolina.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture bubbles and thickens.  Remove the top of the double boiler from the heat and set aside to cool.  

Brush a 15" pizza pan with a little of the melted butter.  Remove about half of the phyllo from a one pound package and set it aside, covered with waxed paper and a damp cloth.  Tightly rewrap the remaining phyllo and refrigerate or freeze.  

On a large work surface, butter half of the phyllo sheets, arranging each one in the pan as you go, overlapping the sheets so that they completely cover the bottom of the pan with about half of each sheet hanging over the side. 

Pread the semolina mixture (it will thicken some as it cools) in the bottom of the pan over the phyllo.  

Butter the remaining sheets of phyllo, laying them over the filling, but do not allow these to hang over the side of the pan.  Generously butter to top layer of phyllo.  Bring the bottom overhang over the top to seal.  Brush with the remaining butter.  Prick the top in many places with a fork.  Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown.

Remove from the oven and sprinkle generously with cinnamon.  Set aside to cool for about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle heavily with confectioners' sugar just before cutting and serving.  (A pizza wheel works great).

Leftovers should be covered and chilled.  Reheat at 300F for about 10 minutes.

Brioche dough can be tricky--larger batches are easier to work with. This recipe conveniently makes enough dough for 2 loafs. You can bake one now and freeze the remaining dough for later use. Be sure to start dough 1 day ahead.
RECIPE INGREDIENTS
1 pound (4 sticks) chilled unsalted butter
1 cup lukewarm water
2 packages dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
5 cups bread flour
3 tablespoons sugar
6 large eggs, chilled
1/4 cup whole milk, chilled
2 teaspoons salt

1 large egg, beaten well

DIRECTIONS
Remove butter from refrigerator as you begin making dough. Combine water, yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in bowl of heavy duty mixer and let stand until mixture is foamy and yeast is dissolved, about 10 minutes. Add 2 cups bread flour and 3 tablespoons sugar and beat with paddle attachment at medium-low speed until mixture is smooth and sticky, about 5 minutes. Beat in 3 eggs, one at a time, beating well to incorporate after each addition. Beat in cold milk. Add remaining 3 cups flour and salt to bowl and beat well. Beat in remaining 3 eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat on low until well mixed.

Change paddle to dough hook. Beat at medium high speed until mixture is smooth, very elastic and barely sticks to finger when touched, about 5 minutes. Using rolling pin, flatten wrapped sticks of butter to 3/4 to 1/2-inch thickness. Unwrap and cut each into 3 pieces. With mixer running, add half of butter, 1 piece at a time, and mix until butter is almost incorporated into dough. Stop mixer and turn dough over using spatula. Add remaining butter 1 piece at a time and continue beating, stopping mixer occasionally to turn dough until all butter is incorporated and smooth dough forms, about 12 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until almost doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Chill 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Dough will rise above rim of bowl.

With plastic wrap in place, punch down dough with plastic. Remove plastic. Using rubber spatula, separate dough from sides of bowl. Cover with plastic and chill overnight. Punch dough down with plastic in place. Remove plastic. On lightly floured surface, roll dough out to 12 x 6-inch log. Cut in half. Wrap half in plastic and freeze. Butter brioche mold. Place dough, cut side down in mold and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours. Meanwhile preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Brush top of dough gently with egg, being careful not to let egg drip onto mold. Bake until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Unmold and cool completely. Brioche can be made 2 days ahead. Wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.

Brown Butter Tuiles

INGREDIENTS:

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 egg whites
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup all purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract


METHOD:

Heat the oven to 350F.

Melt the butter ina heavy skillet over medium heat.  After it melts, continue to cook the butter, watching carefully.  It will foam and subside, then separate into golden butterfat and cloudy white milk solids.  The milk solids will begin to brown.  When they are lightly browned and the butter smells nutty and toasted, remove from the heat and se taside to cool slightly.

Whip the egg whites and sugar in a clean dry bowl until stiff and glossy.  Add the flour, vanilla and brown butter and mix at low speed until blended.  The batter will become thicker as the egg whites lose volume.

On 2 nonstick sheet pans or pans lined with parchment paper, use a spatula or the back of a spoon to pour and spread the batter in very thin circles 8" in diameter.  You will probably be able to fit only two tuiles per pan; they should be very thin, almost so thin that you can see the pan through them.  Bake until light golden brown, 8-10 minutes.  Using a spatula or your fingers, immediately lift the tuile off the pan.  Holding it from above with the tips of your fingers, gently crumble the tuile from the center.  It should look like a fine handkerchief that's been dropped on the floor.  Set aside to cool.

Repeat with the remaining batter.  The batter may stiffen up as the butter cools; you can warm it briefly in the microwave, or set the bowl over hot water to keep the batter warm.

Store cooled tuiles in an airtight container, placing sheets of parchment or wax paper between the tuiles.

- Cookie Crust:
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest, grated
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and chilled
- 1 large egg yolk, lightly beaten
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
- Filling:
- 5 8 oz. pkg cream cheese, softened
- 1 3/4 cups sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 5 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks

METHOD:

Preheat oven to 375F.

Crust:  Combine the flour, sugar and lemon zest.  Using a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture is crumbly.  Using a fork, stir in the egg yolk and vanilla until all the dough is moistened.

Pat one third of the crust over the bottom of a 9" springform pan with it sides removed.  Bake for about 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool.  Grease the sides of the springform pan and attach to the bottom.  Pat the remaining two thirds of the crust around the sides, coming up to a height of about 2".

Increase the oven temperature to 475F.  In a large mixing bowl at medium speed, beat together the cream cheese, sugar, and salt until creamy.  Add the vanilla.  Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the sour cream and mix well.  Pour the mixture into the prepared crust.

Bake for 10 minutes.  Watch the top of the cake to avoid overbrowning.  Reduce the oven temperature to 200F and bake for an additional 60 minutes.

Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.  While the cake is still warm, gently run a thin-bladed knife around the inside edges of the pan to loosen the sides of the cake.  When completely cool, carefully remove the sides of the pan.  Chill for a least 2 hours before serving.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cardamom, and salt.

In the stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, mix the dry ingredients and the butter into the yeast on low speed. Add one egg and continue to beat the dough until it is smooth and sticky. Turn the soft dough onto a floured surface and gently knead a few times. Place the dough into a large oiled bowl, turning the dough once to coat the top. Cover with plastic wrap and allow it to rise for 1 hour, until it doubles in size.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Generously grease a 12-inch round cake pan.

TO FORM THE CAKE: Gently deflate the dough. Turn the dough out onto a generously floured surface and roll out to a large rectangle, about 9 by 16-inches. Spread the almond paste mixture over the surface of the dough. Starting from the long side, roll the dough, jellyroll style, towards you to form a long loaf. Then turn the ends towards each other to form a ring and tuck one end into the other, pinching to seal the seam.

Transfer the ring to the greased cake pan, leaving a 1-inch border from the side of the pan to allow the cake to expand. With kitchen shears, make diagonal cuts, 3/4 of the way into the dough, every 2-inches, all the way around the ring. Be careful to cut all the way through the dough. Lift up a snipped piece and move it towards the center of the ring, move the next snipped piece and turn it towards the outside of the ring. Continue until you have gone completely around the ring.

In a small bowl, lightly beat the remaining egg. Generously brush the surface of the dough with the egg and sprinkle the top with the almonds.

Bake in the oven for 45 to 60 minutes, until the top of the dough is shiny and a deep golden brown. Allow the cake to cool on a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

NOTES:

Serving Ideas : After every meal forever...says Marty.NOTES : Well here we go again...you might notice how many people this serves?  Yes just one if its Marty, the apple pie man.
  But for most of the human race, we can probably get 6-8 servings out of it.  But did I ever tell you about the time I went to visit a farmhouse friend of my Grandma?  Our family had dinner there and the woman who made the dinner, Mary, served each one of us a quarter of a pie for dessert!   Me, being the city girl I was (and still am) was shocked...but loved every minute of it.  I was about 12 and that's when I noticed my hips beginning to widen...wonder what started that?  This pie is super as is our Carol...why do I always bring up farming when I talk about Carol?  She's a city girl now, too.
CHEF'S TRICK...Whenever I make apple pies, I like to mix up apples...Granny Smith's, Winesap, Delicious...whatever.  I think it just tastes good.  And you don't have to peel these apples and a mixup would look pretty.

Your loaves will be ready to place in the oven when you press gently with your finger and it pops back up....this will be after about 45-60 mnutes.  Do not over rise or you will leave nothing to rise in the oven!  Or, another way of saying that is that your bread will have no "oven spring".

Spray your loaf lightly with water and dust with a tablespoon of oatmeal on each loaf.  Place in hot oven and bake for 25-35 minutes.  Thump to check for doneness....your loaves should sound hollow.  This bread is awesome eaten hot from the oven......yikes.

Chicken Stock

INGREDIENTS:

- 6 lbs. chicken bones/pieces
- Mirepoix:
- ~ 1 onion
- 1 leek
- 1-2 carrots
- 2-3 celery
- All cut into small dice.
- 2 crushed garlic cloves
- Bouquet Garni:
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 5-6 whole peppercorns
- 6-8 parsley stems


METHOD:

1.  Roast the chicken parts, without any seasoning,  for about 45 minutes to an hour at 375F.  (If you don't have time to do this, just pile all the bones in the pot, raw.  It just gives the stock a wonderful rich flavor if you have time).
2.  Place the preroasted bones in a stock pot.
3.  Pour fat from roasting pan and deglaze the roasting pan with a little water.  Add to stockpot.  
4.  Cover the bones with cold water,  2 inches above the bones.  Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and skim the scum.
5.  Add the mirepoix and bouquet garni.
6.  Simmer for about 2 - 2 1/2 hours skimming scum if needed.  
7.  Remove bones with slotted spoon.  Strain the stock through a good strainer.
8.  Cool in a water bath* and refrigerate.

*Water bath = Place the pot with the strained stock in the kitchen sink (make sure you plug the sink).  Add water and ice in the sink surrounding the pot to the level even the end point of the stock in the pot.  Allow to cool in this manner in the sink for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Then refrigerate. 

 It is difficult for anything deeper than 3" in the refrigerator to cool fast enough to prevent bacteria from growing.    This is one of those little things that can cause "food poisoning" if not handled correctly!!

NOTES:

NOTES : Think of how many times you have purchased already prepared chicken stock....you will find everything you make with your own chicken stock to be far superior to the purchased.  Use as a base for broth-type soups and puree soups.  Use in place of cream in  mashed potatoes.  Cook  rice in it.  Think of its use when water is requested in a recipe....often chicken stock can work in a savory dish with great improvement in flavor.

6.  Cool the stock in a waterbath and refrigerate.

NOTES:

NOTES : This recipe makes 2 gallons or 128 one-cup servings.  If a white chicken stock is desired, do not pre-roast the  bones and use chopped mushroom stems instead of carrots; otherwise, for deeper color use carrots and pre-roast the bones.

Chile Rellenos

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 1/2 lbs. spinach leaves, stems removed
- salt to taste
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/3 cup raisins
- 1/3 cup pinenuts
- 1/2 cup water
- 6 ounces queso fresco, cut in 6 narrow pieces
- 6 poblano chiles, roasted and left whole
- 6 large eggs, divided
- 6 tablespoons flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt


METHOD:

Place spinach in a saucepan with only the rinsing water slinging to the leaves and spinkle with salt.  Place over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until wilted, about 5 minutes.  Drain well, squeeze out any excess moisture, and chop coarsely.

Preheat oven to 350F.  Over medium-high heat, warm the oil and add the raisins, pinenuts and greens and cook, stirring constantly, until totally dry, about 3 minutes.  Pour in the water and add salt, if needed.  Remember the cheese is quite salty.  Continue to stir until the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat; let cool.  Carefully peel the chiles.  Leaving the stem end intact, make a lengthwise slit in each chile and remove the seeds and veins, taking care not to break the walls.

Divide the greens and cheese among the chiles, stuffing them carefully so as not to tear them and allowing them to close completely with overlapping edges. 

Whip the egg whites until almost stiff, but still slightly soft.  Whip the yolks separately.  Gently fold in flour and egg yolks alternately into the egg whites.  Dip the rellenos into the batter, gently, and place on griddle to saute briefly until golden.  Place on sheet pan and place in a low oven to keep warm.

Remove the chiles from the oven and transfer to a serving platter or individual plates.  Pour Roasted Tomato Sauce around them and top with sour cream.

Chinese Almond Cookies

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 25 minutes

Ingredients:

2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
3/4 cup white sugar (can add up to 2 more tablespoons, if desired)
1 egg
2 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1/4 pound whole, blanched almonds (one for each cookie)
1 egg, lightly beaten
Preparation:

1.Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (162.5 degrees Celsius).
2.In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the butter or margarine, shortening, and sugar. Add the egg and almond extract and beat until well blended. Add to the flour mixture and mix well. Note: The dough will be crumbly at this point, but don't worry - that is what it's supposed to be like.
3. Use your fingers to form the mixture into a dough, and then form the dough into 2 rolls or logs that are 10 to 12 inches long. Wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours (this will make it easier to shape the dough into circles).
4. Take a log and lightly score the dough at 3/4 inch intervals so that you have 15 pieces and cut the dough. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a lightly greased cookie tray, approximately 1 1/2 inches apart. Place an almond in the center of each cookie and press down lightly. Repeat with the remaining dough.
5. Brush each cookie lightly with beaten egg before baking. Bake for 15 minutes to 18 minutes, until golden brown. Cool and store in a sealed container.

Chipotle Shrimp

INGREDIENTS:

- 6 cloves garlic
- 1 small white onion, sliced 1/4" thick
- 1 medium tomato, ripe
- 3/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons canned chipotle chiles (2-4 tablespoons), drained and chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
- 2 lbs. shrimp, medium


METHOD:

On an ungreased griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat, roast the garlic cloves, turning occasionally, until soft (they will blacken in spots), about 15 minutes.  Cool and peel.

Lay the onions on the griddle and let sear, brown and soften about 5 minutes per side.

Roast the tomatoes in the same pan until blackened about 6 minutes or more.  Cool and peel, collecting the juces with the tomatoes.

Combine all roasted ingredients in a food processor, along with the pepper, cloves and 1/4 cup of water.  Process to a medium-smooth puree.

In a very large (12") skillet, heat the oil over medium-high.  When hot enough to make a drop of the puree sizzle noisily, add it all at once.  Stir for several minutes as the mixture sears and darkens, then reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook, sitrring regularly, until very thick, about 5 minutes.  A tablespoon at a time, stir in the Chipotle, tasting until the tick salsa suits your own taste for spiciness.  Taste, season with salt and remove from heat.

The shrimp:  Peel the shrimp, leaving the final joint and tail intact.  One at a time devein the shrimp.  

Return the skillet with the sauce to medium-high heat.  Add the shrimp, then slowly stir and turn for about 3-4 minutes, until the shrimp are just cooked through.  (The sauce should nicely coat the shrimp without a pool around them).  Taste a shrimp, sprinkle on a little more salt if necessary.

Chocolate Angel Food Cake

INGREDIENTS:

- 1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa (Dutch
- processed)
- 1/4 cup boiling water
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 3/4 cups sugar
- 1 cup cake flour, sifted
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 16 large egg whites, (2 liquid cups)
- 2 teaspoons cream of tartar


METHOD:

Preheat oven to 350F.  

In a medium boil combine the cocoa and boiling water and whisk until smooth.  Whisk in vanilla.

In another medium bowl beat the egg whites until frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat until soft peaks form when the beater is raised.  Gradually beat in the remaining 1 cup sugar, beating until very stiff peaks form when the beater is raised slowly.  Remove 1 heaping cup of egg whites and place it onto the cocoa mixture.

Dust the flour mixture over the remaining whites, 1/4 cup at a time, and fold in quickly but gently.  It is not necessary to incorporate every speck until the last addition.  A large balloon whire whisk or slotted skimmer also works well.

Whisk together the egg white and cocoa mixture and fold into the batter until uniform.  Pour into the tube pan (the batter will come to 3/4 inch from the top), run a small metal spatula or knife through the batter to prevent air pockets and bake for 40 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when lightly pressed.  (The center will rise above the pan while baking and sink slightly when done.  The surface will have deep cracks like a souffle.)

Invert the pan, placing the tube opening over the neck of a wine bottle to suspend it well above the counter and cool the cake completely in the pan.  About 1 1/2 hours.

Loosen the sides wiht a long metal spatula and remove the center core of the pan.  Dislodge the bottom and center coree with ametal spatula or thin, sharp knife.

- 2/3 cup Framboise
- 2 cups chocolate ganache, approximately
- 1-1 1/2 cups whipped cream*


METHOD:

Split cooled genoise into layers.  Place layer on cake rack over parchment line sheet pan.  Douse a few tablespoons of Framboise on the first layer.  Spread about 1/2 cup raspberry jam on layer and then cover with whipped cream.  Place next layer(s) on top and repeat.  End with only a dousing of Framboise on top layer.  Check around the sides to remove any seeping whipped cream.  Place in refrigerator for about 15 minutes to set slightly.

Meanwhile make ganache.  

Remove cake from refrigerator and brush crumbs off cake.  Make sure sides are smooth of whipped cream and brush crumbs off.  Pour about 1 cup of ganache on top of cake and allow to run down the sides, smoothing from the top down with a spatula.  Place in the refrigerator for another 15 minutes.  Keep the remaining ganache warm over a bain marie.

Chocolate Madeleines

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg white
- 1 cup flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa, preferably Dutch process
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 3 tablespoons canola oil
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon instant coffee granules
- 1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, or powdered sugar for decoration


METHOD:

Preheat oven to 400F.  Spray a madeleine pan with  nonstick cooking spray.  Dust with flour or cocoa tapping out excess.

Place whole egg and egg white in a mixing bowl and set the bowl in a larger pan of hot water to warm while you prepare the remaining ingredients.  Stir the eggs occasionally.

Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a bowl; set aside.  Combine buttermilk and oil and set aside.

Take the egg bowl off the water, add sugar and beat with an electric mixer on high speed until the mixture is thickened and pale, about 5 minutes (to ribbon stage).  Blend in vanilla and coffee.  With a rubber spatula, alternately fold the dry ingredients and the buttermilk mixture into the egg mixture, making 3 additions of dry ingredients and 2 additions of liquid.

Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls into the prepared pan, filling each depression about three-fourths full; you will use about half of the batter.  Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the tops of the madeleines spring back when touched lightly.  Immediately loosen the cakes from the pan and invert onto a wire rack to cool.  Clean pans before adding new batter (or they will stick).

Melt the chocolate in  a plastic bag in the microwave.  Snip a small hole in one corner of the bag and quickly squeeze out lines of chocolate over the cookies.

Chocolate Yogurt Mousse

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 ounces semisweet chocolate, dark
- 1 cup yogurt cheese, + 2 tablespoons
- 1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder, sifted twice
- 8 egg white
- 2/3 cup sugar


METHOD:

Place the chocolate in a microwavable bowl and microwave on Hight for 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval, until melted.  Stir a few spoonfuls of the yogurt cheese into the warm chocolate just to cool it slightly, then stir the chocolate mixture into the remaining yogurt cheese.

Fill a large saucepan twothirds full of water and bring to a simmer.  Place the bowl of yogurt mixture over the hot water, then fold in the cocoa, stirring gently, until glossy (this loosens the mixture and makes it easier to fold in the meringue).  Remove bowl from the saucepan; set aside and keep warm.

To prepare the meringue, combine the egg whites and sugar in a clean stainless-steel bowl.  Place the bowl over the saucepan of simmering water and gently whisk until the egg whites are foamy and reach 135F on an instant-read thermometer.  Remove the bowl from the heat and with an electric mixer on medium speed beat the egg whites until medium peaks form, 3-5 minutes.  

Fold the meringue into the yogurt mixture and spoon the mousse into pretty glasses.  Chill until firm, about 4 hours.

Place water in large electric mixer bowl.  Add yeast.  Add 8 cups of flour.  Mix with dough hook until all incorporated.  Add more flour if needed.  Keep in mind that this is a fairly wet dough.  It should have some slack and is not as compact as your normal loaf when completely mixed.  Continue mixing for 6 minutes.  

Place a towel over the bowl with the dough hook still in the dough.  Allow to rest for 20 minutes.  This procedure is called "autolyse" with the purpose of allowing  the dough to rest giving the flour a chance to expand and absorb the liquid.

After 20 minutes, turn on the mixer again and add the salt.  Mix for 2 minutes.  Add the milk and olive oil, slowly while running.  Mix for 2 minutes.  At this point the dough will be fairly slack.

Take the dough hook off.  Allow to rise for 1-1 1/2 hours.  Place in the refrigerator and allow to finish rising overnight.

The next day, remove your dough from the refrigerator.  Make sure your bread/pizza stone is in the oven and turn your oven on to 425F-450F.  Allow the dough to rest about an hour.  During this time your oven will become very hot, heating all the sides, the stone and readying the oven for your loaves.

After about an hour, in preparation for shaping your loaves, toss some semolina flour covering a large space (18" across) on your work surface.  Over that toss some bread flour...all in a light covering.  Then tip the bowl of dough pouring out the bread dough, scraping the sides to get all the dough out.  It should be in a big, poured lump.

Cut the lump with a dough cutter in half and then in half again.  Place a piece of parchment paper on the underside (upside down) of a sheet pan.  Sprinkle with semolina.  Pick up one of the "quarter" blobs without doing anything to it, and plop it on the parchment, stretching slightly to give it some length.  Repeat this with the rest of the dough quarters right before placing in the oven.  If you can fit two loaves into your oven, do two at a time.  Otherwise just do one.

Spray the loaf with water.  Take to the oven and "slip" parchment paper and bread onto the stone.  Close the oven quick.  Give it about 20 minutes and remove with a baker's peel to a rack to cool.  SOURCE: Apple Charlotte

Citrus Natillas

INGREDIENTS:

- Poached Egg Whites:
- 12 large egg whites
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup sugar
- Custard:
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 6 scrapes fresh nutmeg
- 12 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup orange juice
- 5 cups milk, scalded
- 2 cups cream
- 3 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 teaspoon grated orange peel
- powdered sugar for glazing


METHOD:

Egg Whites:  Place egg whites in bowl with salt and beat with an electric mixer until soft peaks are reached.  Gradually sprinkle in the sugar, still whipping, until glossy and stiff peaks are reached and sugar dissolved.

Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a wide shallow fry pan and turn the heat down so that the wate simmers slowly (an occasional bubble breaking the surface).  Drop the egg whites into the water by large spoonfuls (for 12 servings).  You may have to do this in two or three batches.  They will swell and poach in a minute or two.  Turn them over if needed.  Drain on paper towels.

Custard:  Mix the cornstarch, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a bowl, add the egg yolks and beat at a low speed with a mixer or whisk.  Gradually pour in the orange juice and scalded milk.  Blend and then add the cream.  Pour the custard into a saucepan and heat, stirring, over low heat.  It will take about 12-15 minutes to thicken.  It has to cook until the cornstarch looses its raw taste...do not hurry the process.  The custard should not bowl.  Remove from the heat and add the vanilla and orange peel.

Assembling:  Place the drained egg whites in a shallow baking dish.  Pour the egg custard over and chill at least 2 hours.  When ready to serve, sprinkle the surface with powdered sugar from a sieve and place the pudding under the broiler to brown the peaks and as much of the rest of the sugar as possible.  Serve!!

Classic Roast Beef & Gravy

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Classic Roast Beef and Gravy
The best roast beef is cooked gently to keep all its juices inside. But without enough pan drippings, how do you make rich, beefy gravy? Here’s what we discovered:

Test Kitchen Discoveries

The test kitchen’s top cut for a beef roast that balances flavor, tenderness, and economy is top sirloin roast. Look for a roast with a thick fat cap, which will render as the beef roasts and keep it moist.
After seasoning with salt and pepper, let the roast sit to promote well-seasoned, even juicier meat. Sear each side on the stovetop before roasting to develop a flavorful crust.
The right roasting temperature produced juicy meat (having expelled very little liquid), a uniformly rosy interior (no gray ring from too much heat), and precious little liquid in the roasting pan.
Without pan drippings to make gravy, we used the rendered fat and flavorful brown bits left behind from searing the meat on the stovetop as our gravy base.
For the gravy, sauté mushrooms (which greatly improve the “meaty” flavor of the gravy) onion, carrots, and celery in the rendered fat before adding tomato paste (which contributes body), garlic, and flour. Then stir in beef broth and red wine, making sure to scrape up any flavor-rich browned bits with a wooden spoon.
After straining the gravy, we add Worcestershire sauce, whose salty, sweet, and acidic essence makes the gravy taste truly rich and meaty.SOURCE: Cooks Country

METHOD:

Coconut Cake with Fluffy Icing
Recipe created by Art Smith

 
This fluffy cake looks like it floated right down from heaven!

Ingredients:Makes 12 servings

3/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 1/2 cups sugar
8 egg yolks
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter , cut into 8 pieces
Grated zest of 2 lemons
Pinch of salt
3 cups cake flour (not self-rising)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups sugar
16 tablespoons (2 sticks) butter , softened
4 eggs , at room temperature, separated
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup well-stirred, canned unsweetened coconut milk
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 egg whites , at room temperature
2 teaspoons corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon   cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 bag (17 ounces) shredded sweetened coconut (2 2/3 cups)
In a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan, combine lemon juice and 1/2 cup water. Add cornstarch, and whisk to dissolve. Add sugar, egg yolks, butter, lemon zest and salt. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture comes to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and whisk 1 minute. Strain through a coarse sieve into a medium bowl. Let cool to room temperature, press a piece of plastic wrap directly on surface, and refrigerate until very cold. (Filling may be prepared up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated.) 

Position a rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 350°. Lightly butter and flour three 9-inch round cake pans; tap out excess flour. Line bottoms of pans with parchment paper. 

In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt. In a large bowl, cream sugar and butter with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg yolks, one at a time, then vanilla. On low speed, add flour in three 1-cup additions, alternating with two 1/2-cup additions of coconut milk, beginning and ending with flour, and beat until smooth, scraping bowl often with a rubber spatula. In a medium bowl, beat egg whites (with clean beaters) on high speed until they form stiff peaks. Whisk 1/4 of the whites into batter, and then fold in remainder. Spread evenly in pans. 

Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. Be sure pans don't touch each other and that they clear sides of oven by 2 inches. 

Let cakes cool in pans on wire racks 10 minutes. Invert onto racks and unmold, removing parchment paper. Turn right sides up and cool completely. 

In the bottom of a double boiler, simmer water. In the top of a double boiler, combine sugar, egg whites, corn syrup, cream of tartar and 1/3 cup water. Place over simmering water. Beat on high speed with a handheld electric mixer until icing forms soft peaks, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and beat in vanilla. Continue beating 5 minutes, or just until stiff peaks form. 

Place one layer upside down on a serving plate. Spread with half of lemon filling. Place another layer on top, right side up. Spread with remaining half of lemon filling. Add the final layer right side up. Spread icing over top and then sides of cake. Press handfuls of coconut all over icing. (Cake tastes best the day it is made.)

Coffee Ice Cream

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup half and half
- 2 cups whipping cream
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 6 egg yolks
- 1 cup whole coffee beans


METHOD:

Add  half & half, cream and sugar to a sauce pot and warm the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved.  Add the coffee beans.  Bring to a boil and allow to infuse for a few minutes.
2.  Whisk the egg yolks just enough to mix them and whisk in some of the hot half & half mixture.  Return to the pan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard coats the spoon (when you draw a finger across the custard coating the back of the spoon, your finger should leave a clear trail).
3.  Strain through a medium-fine strainer into a metal bowl or container  to remove any lumps that may have formed.    Place this container into another bowl of ice water and chill until mixture is cold. Cover and place in refrigerator and continue to chill over several hours or overnight.
4.  When you are ready to reeze the mixture.   Freeze according to the directions for your ice cream maker.  If you want to add chocolate chunks or nuts, add about 10-15 minutes into the freezing process, to keep the chunks suspended.

Frozen desserts should be stored in non-reactive containers -- plastic or glass--tightly covered.  Aluminum foil must not contact their surfaces.  They should be stored at 0 degrees F for best quality, but warmed to 5 F- 7 F before serving.

Cold Chicken Salad with Coconut, Peanuts & Crispy Rice Sticks

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 lbs. whole fresh chicken breasts, bone in, skin on, at room temperature
- 4 quarter size pieces ginger, smashed
- 2 fat scallions, cut into 1" pieces
- 1/4 teaspoon Szechwan peppercorns
- Vinaigrette:
- 6 tablespoons pickled ginger juice
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dried red chili flakes
- 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp. canola oil
- Salad:
- 4 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 6 tablespoons sweetened coconut flakes
- 2/3 cup roasted peanuts
- 2 cups English cucumber, thick julienne
- 2 teaspoons jalapeno chile pepper, paper thin slices
- 3 tablespoons pickled ginger
- 6 cups crispy rice sticks
- coriander sprigs, for garnish (cilantro)


METHOD:

Crispy Rice Sticks:  Pull apart the rice
                        sticks so that you have a very thin web of
                        rice sticks.
                        Add oil to a depth of 2" in a wok.  Bring
                        the oil to 375F (it will puff a single
                        rice stick on contact.).  Do not let the
                        temperature climb. Toss the noodles into
                        the oil, a small batch at a time.  They
                        will puff...turn over the nest with tongs.
                        Drain.

Poached Chicken Breasts:  Wash carefully, making sure to remove all blood.  In a heavy dutch oven, partially fill with cold water.  Add ginger, scallion and peppercorns.  Bring to a rolling boil over high heat.

Submerge the chicken in the liquid, cover the pot tightly and turn off the heat.  Allow the chicken to sit, tightly covered and undisturbed, for 2 hours.  You can leave it longer, for convience, but it will not cook further.

Drain the chicken and discard liquid (not enough flavor to keep for stock).  Remove the skin and discard. Remove the meat from the bone.  Cut the meat crosswise against the grain into diagonal ribbons 1/4 inch thick.

Vinaigrette:  Whisk the ginger juice, vinegar, salt, chile flakes and allow to stand 5 minutes to infuse.  Add the oil in a thin stream to emulsify.

Toast the sesame seeds and coconut in the oven.  Watch carefully as they burn easily.  Do each on its own separate pan.

Just before serving, toss the chicken, peanuts, sesame seeds, coconut, cucumber, chili rings and pickled ginger.  Rewhisk the vinaigrette and add it to this mixture.

Mound the salad on individual plates or on a large platter.  Crown and rim the reserved rice stick and add springs of fresh coriander for garnish (cilantro).

Cookie Pizza

INGREDIENTS:

- Sugar Cookie Dough:
- 3 cups all purpose white flour, plus more if needed
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, slightly softened
- 1 (scant) cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon lemon or almond extract
- Topping:
- 1 1/3 cups cherry preserves
- 2/3 cup dried sweetened cranberries, coarsely chopped
- 2/3 cup pecans or walnuts, chopped, optional
- 2/3 cup shredded sweetened coconut
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate morsels
- 2/3 cup white chocolate, grated
- 1/4 cup dried sweetened cranberries
- 1/4 cup pistachios, chopped, optional


METHOD:

Dough:  In large bowl, thoroughly stir together the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. 
 In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat together the butter and sugar until very light and fluffy.  Beat in the egg, milk, vanilla and lemon or almond extract until very well blended and smooth.

Gradually beat or stir in the flour mixture to form a smooth, slightly stiff dough.  If it seems soft, stir in up to 3 tablespoons more flour.  Let the dough stand for about 5 minutes, or until firmed up slightly.  Place in the refrigerator for about 1/2 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Divide the dough in half for two 12" pizza pans (or divide into more pieces for smaller pans).  Spray 2 pizza pans with non-stick spray.  With lightly greased hands, pat and press the dough out until it covers the entire pan bottom in an evenly thick layer.  Push any uneven dough edges back inside the pan, shaping so the crust edge is smooth and about 2/3 inch thick all the way around; the thicker edge keeps the dough from overbaking while the interior gets done.

In a small bowl, stir together the cherry preserves and copped cranberries.  For each pizza, spread half of the "sauce" evenly over the dough to within 1/4 inch of the edge.

Bake one pizza at a time in the middle of the oven for 16-19 minutes, or until the dough is tinged with brown all over and just slightly darker at the edges.  Remove from the oven.  For each pizza, evenly sprinkle with half the pecans or walnuts, coconut and semisweet chocolate morsels.  Top each with half the white chocolate, followed by half the cranberries and pistachios.  Return to the oven and bake for 4-5 minutes, or until the white chocolate begins to melt and brown on top.  Transfer the sheet to a wire rack and let stand until cooled to warm.  

Using a pizza cutter or large knife cut the pizza into quarters, eighths and then sixteenths, wiping the knife clean between cuts.  Let stand until completely cooled.

Store in pizza pan, covered with foil or in an airtight container for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 1 month.

Creamy Polenta

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 quarts water
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 cups polenta
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese


METHOD:

Put the 2 quarts of water in a large saucepan on high heat.  Meanwhile take a dutch oven and put in as much water that will cover the bottom of the saucepan once you balance it on top of the dutch oven for a water bath, almost like a double boiler.  Bring the dutch oven pan to a good heavy simmer.

Bring the water in the saucepan to a brisk boil and add the salt.  Put the polenta in a measuring cup from which you can pour it.  With a slender but sturdy wood spoon, create a vortex in the water by swirling it in one direction only.

While the water is swirling in a vortex, drizzle in the polenta "a pioggia" (like it is raining).  Lower the heat so that the polenta intermittently bubbles on the surface and "spits" at you and continue to stir for about 3 minutes or so.  When the polenta begins to thicken place the lid on the pan and put it in the water bath (do not submerge it!).  Make sure the simmering water below reaches up as high as possible underneath the top piece.  Cook for about 1 1/2 hours stirring every 30 minutes or so.  Taste for doneness.   It should be yellow, smooth shiny and sweet tasting.  If it is slightly bitter, cook it longer.  This can be held in a slowly simmering bath in perfect condition for up to 4 hours.  If it gets too dry, add lightly salted boiling water and stir vigorously.

NOTES:

Serving Ideas : Polenta can be served soft or set, with a sauce or not!NOTES : This is a simple way to prepare polenta and it will turn out perfect every time...don't buy it already made as this is truely wonderful.  I learned this in a cooking class with Carlo Middione and have made it lots of times with great success.

Creamy Smashed Potatoes

INGREDIENTS:

- 10 large potatoes, russets, reds, Yukon Golds...your choice
- 1 cube butter
- 1 1/2 cups cream or milk
- salt and pepper, to taste
- If you want you can add: cooked bacon
- bits, green onions, chopped, herbs, even
- grated cheese.


METHOD:

Wash potatoes well, leaving skins on.  Cut into quarters and place in large pot of cold, salted water.  Bring the water and potatoes to a boil and turn the stove down to simmer and finish cooking.  Cook for about 20-25 minutes until potatoes are cooked through.

Carefully (you may need an adult's help here), pour the potatoes into a large colander to drain.  Meanwhile, melt the butter and warm the cream or milk in the same pan.  When the mixture is starting to bubble, slightly, turn off the burner.  Carefully, pour the potatoes back into the pot and begin smashing with a potato masher until all the skins and potatoes are well mashed.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  At this point, add addtional items, if you wish....although, it is delicious right now!!

Return all to pan and continue to cook over medium heat until mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of a wooden spoon (you should be able to run your finger across the back of the spoon and it will leave a path).  Immediately remove from heat and strain into a bowl.  Add flavoring of choice (vanilla, almond or liquor).  Place into refrigerator and serve as desired.

Creole Fried Chicken

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

From the episode: Fried Chicken

To ensure even cooking, breasts should be halved crosswise and leg quarters separated into thighs and drumsticks. We prefer the brash flavor of Louisiana’s own Tabasco sauce in this recipe, but any hot sauce will work. In step 1, do not soak the chicken longer than 8 hours, or it will be too salty.

Serves 4 to 6.  

INGREDIENTS
Seasoned Brine
1	quart water
1/4	cup sugar
3	tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3	tablespoons Tabasco sauce
2	tablespoons salt
1	tablespoon garlic powder
4	pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (see note)
Creole Coating
1	tablespoon black pepper
1	tablespoon dried oregano
1	tablespoon garlic powder
2	teaspoons onion powder
2	teaspoons cayenne pepper
1	teaspoon white pepper
1	teaspoon celery salt
2	cups all-purpose flour
3	quarts peanut oil or vegetable shortening
INSTRUCTIONS
1. For the seasoned brine: Whisk water, sugar, Worcestershire, Tabasco, salt, and garlic powder in large bowl until sugar and salt dissolve. Add chicken and refrigerate, covered, for 1 hour or up to 8 hours.

2. For the Creole coating: Combine black pepper, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, white pepper, and celery salt in large bowl; reserve 4 tablespoons spice mixture. Add flour to bowl with remaining spice mixture and stir to combine.

3. Remove chicken from refrigerator and pour off brine. Sprinkle chicken with 3 tablespoons reserved spice mixture and toss to coat. Working in batches of two, dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture. Shake excess flour from chicken and transfer to wire rack. (Do not discard flour mixture.)

4. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Return chicken pieces to flour mixture and turn to coat. Fry half of chicken, adjusting burner as necessary to maintain oil temperature between 300 and 325 degrees, until deep golden brown and white meat registers 160 degrees (or dark meat registers 175 degrees), 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer chicken to clean wire rack set over baking sheet and place in oven. Bring oil back to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining chicken. Sprinkle crisp chicken with remaining tablespoon spice mixture. Serve.

Crispy Corn-Masa Crepes

INGREDIENTS:

- Crepes:
- 3 large eggs
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 1/4 cup flour
- 1/4 cup fresh masa for tortillas or 1/3 cup masa
- harina, mixed with 1/4 cup hot water
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- Vegetable Filling:
- 2 fresh poblano chiles
- 1 small white onion
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 ears corn, kernals cut from cobs
- 2 medium zucchini
- 4 ounces fresh spinach, chopped
- 1/2 cup cilantro leaves, whole
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- For Finishing the Dish:
- 1 cup Thick Cream or creme fraiche
- 3/4 cup Monterey jack cheese, shredded
- 3 tablespoons cilantro, for garnish


METHOD:

36 hours before need make Thick Cream:  Pour 1 cup heavy whipping cream in a small saucepan and set over low heat, stirring just until the chill is off; do not heat above 100F.  Remove from the heat, stir in 2 teaspoons buttermilk (or sour cream or plain yogurt) and pour into a clean glass jar.  Place the lid on jar, but don't tighten it, and put in a warm (80-90F) spot.  Let the cream develop for 12-24 hours, until noticeable thicker.  Stir gently and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight to chill and complete the thickening.  Covered and refrigerated, will keep for 10 days or so.

The Crepe Batter:  Place all the ingredients except the butter in a food processor or blender.  Process until smooth, stopping the machine once to scrape down the sides.  With the machine rumming, pour in the melted butter.  Pour into a pitcher and set aside to rest for 2 hours.

Making the Crepes:  Set a 7" skillet over medium-high heat and brush very lightly with butter.  When quite hot, pour in about 1/4 cup of the batter, quickly swirl it around to coat the bottom, then immediately pour the excess back into the pitcher.  Using your fingers or a narrow spatula, flip the crepe (it should be golden brown).  Cook about a minute longer, until the underneath is golden, then remove to a plate.  Continue making crepes in the same manner, buttering the pan from time to time and stacking the finshed crepes on top of one another; cover with plastic wrape.  You should have 12 to 14 crepes.

The Vegetable Filling:  Roast the chiles directly over a gas flame turning until blackened on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand 5 minutes.  Peel, pull out the stema nd seed pod, then rinse briefly to remove bits of skin and seeds.  Slice into 1/4" strips.

In a large skillet, cook the onion in the oil  over medium heat until lightly browned, 5-7 minutes.  Add the chiles, corn kernels, zucchini, spinach, cilantro and milk.  Cook, stirring freequently, until the zucchini is just tender and the milk has evaporated, about 7 minutes.  Taste and season with salt and let cool.

Filling the crepes:  Lay out a crepe, fold the top third down, spoon is a portion of filling and a bit of the Jack cheese in the middle, then fold the point at the upper right-hand side toward the bottom left-hand corner; fold the point at the upper left.  Fill and fold the remainder of the crepes, lay on a parchment-lined or nonstick baking sheet, then bake in a 375F oven until crispy.  *  Serve with a bit of greens, Tomatillo-Green Quacamole and a drizzle of Thick Cream.

*  Alternatively (non-crisp)Filling and Fishing:  Lay out a crepe, prettiest-side down, and spoon about 1/4 cup of the vegetable filling down the middle.  Roll up to enclose the filling and place in a buttered 13x9" baking dish, preferable one that will look nice on a table.  Continue spooning and rolling until all crepes are filled.  Turn on the oven to 400F.  Stir the Tick Cream until smooth (if it too thick, stir in a little milk) and drizzle over the crepes.  Sprinkle with the cheese.  Bake until heated through and bubbling, about 15 minutes.  Strew the cilantro over the crepes and they're ready to serve.

Advance Preparation:  These crepes can be made a couple of days in advance but you will need to put a piece of plastic wrap between each crepe so they don't stick together, then wrap them well and refirgerate.  The filling can be made a few hours in advance but you will want to drain off any accumulated liquid from it.  Fill the crepes and assemble the dish just before baking.

Czarninia (pronounced Cha-r[rolled R]-nina)

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 3-4 pound live duck, killed, reserve blood, cut in pieces
- 3 tablespoons vinegar (keeps blood from coagulating)
- 1 lb. mirepoix, small dice
- 1 BG:
- thyme
- parsley stems
- bay leaf
- peppercorns
- 12 medium pitted prunes
- Add to stock after straining:
- 1 small onion, small dice, sauteed
- 2 carrots, small dice, sauteed
- 12 medium prunes, small dice
- 1/2 cup yellow raisins
- 2 raw pears, peeled, cored, small dice
- sour cream equal to blood/vinegar mixture


METHOD:

1.  Ring the neck of the duck and decapitate by "bending the beak over to the neck" and cutting between the vertebrae.  Drain the blood and reserve with the vinegar.  Cover and refrigerate.   Defeather and clean the duck.

2.  Place the duck, the mirepoix, the BG and the first set of prunes in a pot and cover with water.  Cook for approximately 1 1/2 hours, skimming the surface of skum as it rises.

3.  Take the bones and meat from the stock.  Separate the meat from the bones and set aside and keep warm.  Discard the bones.  Strain the stock discarding what is left in the strainer.  

4.  Place the stock back on the stove over medium low heat.   Remove the blood and vinegar mixture from the refrigerator and set aside.

5.  Saute the onions and carrots in a small amount of butter until the vegetables are just cooked through.

6.  While the onions and carrots are cooking add the additional prunes (the first ones were strained out), the raisins and pears to the stock.  When the vegetables are just barely cooked through, add to the stock.

7.  Take the blood and vinegar mixture, add an equal amount of sour cream  and temper this mixture with the stock bringing the temperature up slowly before adding it to the stock, heating carefully.   Do not boil.

8.  Serve in bowls with duck meat on the side.

NOTES:

NOTES : To...Chef Terry:  This dish is a traditional and festive Polish dish often prepared during holiday seasons like Easter or Christmas.  According to Mom & Dad Z. it is served in a bowl with the reserved duck meat and some boiled potatoes or homemade noodles (or both) on the side to be added to the soup as desired.  The perfect bread for this Polish dish, Dad says, is a deep, dark pumpernickel.  Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy...*Note:  The most enjoyable thing about this recipe was obtaining it over the phone as they discussed (??)  (while I tried to get it all down) the best ways according to their Polish recollection...I laughed my head off!  They finally agreed that I had it when I repeated what I thought I heard back to them!!!  Thanks for asking for it.  Its good we have it down.

Dark Chocolate Mousse

INGREDIENTS:

- 16 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin
- 3 tablespoons coffee, strong
- 6 tablespoons Grand Marnier
- 1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt
- 1/2 cup nonfat cottage cheese
- 4 egg whites, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup sugar


METHOD:

Melt the chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water.  Stir until smooth and completely melted.  Cool slightly.

In a small saucepan, soften the gelatin in 1/4 cup cold water  then dissolve over medium-high heat.  Add the coffee and Grand Marnier and slowly whisk until the gelatin mixture thickens slightly -- enough to glaze a spoon but not jell.  Transfer to a large mixing bowl.  Cool to room temperature.

In a food processor or blender mix together the yogurt and cottage cheese. Stir in this mixture and the melted chocolate to the gelatin mixture  until well blended.  Allow the mixture to thicken slightly at room temperature (10-20 minutes).

Beat the egg whites to soft peaks.  Beat in the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture and blend well.

Spoon into individual dessert glasses or a large serving bowl.  Chill for at least 2 hours before serving.

Duxelle of Mushrooms Strudel

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large shallot, minced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups crimini mushrooms, chopped in the food processer
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh sage, minced
- salt to taste, remembering that cheese will add more salt
- pinch red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons marsala wine
- 1  pound baby spinach
- 4 ounces goat cheese
- 15 sheets phyllo dough
- 1 cube butter, melted


METHOD:

Place olive oil in saute pan.  Add shallots and cook briefly.  Add garlic and cook briefly.  Add thyme and sage and then mushrooms, salt and chile flakes and cook until liquid has evaporated.  Add marsala.  Add spinach and cook until wilted.  Cool to room temperature.  Add crumbled goat cheese.  Taste to correct seasoning.  

Open phyllo and butter a sheet with a pastry brush dipped in the melted butter.  Lay this sheet  on a sheet pan lined with parchment.  Continue to butter each sheet individually, until you have 5 stacked.  Spread 1/3 of the mushroom mixture over the entire surface of the sheet on top, leaving 1" all around.  Carefully roll, jelly-roll fashion, making sure the seam is on the bottom.  Fold the ends over and in (like a package).  Brush with butter.

Repeat this two more times until you have three strudels.  Score each strudel with a razor blade scoring diagonally about 1 1/2" apart.  This allows the steam to escape.  Place in a 375F-400F oven for about 20-25 minutes until golden and puffy.  

Allow to cool briefly, about 10 minutes or longer, and cut diagonally into  1 1/2" pieces.  Serve with Rosemary & Peppered Plum Sauce.

- dijon mustard, if desired
- sugar, if desired
- garlic, minced, if desired


METHOD:

The "if desired" items are to be added if you would like.  The viniagrette will be wonderful with only acid, olive oil and salt and pepper.  But you can add several of the "if desired" items if you wish.  Always consider what you are serving it with and what sounds good to you.

If you are serving wine, make your viniagrette slightly "rounder", meaning balancing with more oil so as not to conflict with the wine you are serving.

Eggnog Ice Cream

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup milk
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 5 large egg yolks
- 2 1/4 cups whipping cream
- 2 1/2  tablespoons bourbon
- 1 tablespoon brandy
- freshly grated nutmeg


METHOD:

Have a bowl and strainer ready to strain your cooked "custard" mixture as soon as it has cooked.  

Heat milk and sugar in a stainless steel saucepan until sugar dissolves and mixture is heated.  

Meantime, gently beat egg yolks to break and mix together (not until frothy).  When the milk mixture is hot, gently pour it into the egg yolks while stirring (this is called "tempering" the egg yolks).  Then pour the mixture back into the pan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture coats the back of the wooden spoon and you can run your finger through it leaving a trail (this will only take a few minutes).

Immediately, strain into your clean bowl.  Add whipping cream, bourbon, brandy and nutmeg.  Allow to cool completely in the refrigerator (overnight is great) before freezing according to manufacturer's directions in ice cream freezer.SOURCE: Adpated from Chez Panisse

Eight Precious Treasure Rice Pudding

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 cups sweet rice or Italian risotto rice, washed & soaked in cold water
- 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening
- 6 blanched almonds, sliced in half
- 3 red marachino cherries, sliced in rounds
- 3 green marachino cherries, sliced in rounds
- 3 dates, pitted, sliced/half
- 3 small pieces of crystallized pineapple, sliced in half
- 1 piece crystallized lemon (citron), sliced/6 pieces
- 6 golden raisins, soaked until swell
- 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
- 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup Chinese Sweet Red Bean Paste
- 3 tablespoons more of granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup water
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1/4 cup red marachino cherry liquid


METHOD:

1.  Cook the rice according to the directions in the basic recipe.
Basic Glutinous Rice:  Soak rice for at least 30 minutes before using.
                                 2 cups glutinous (sticky) rice
                                 4 cups cold water
Place rice in a saucepan and pour in enough water to cover.  Let soak 30 minutes or longer. 

 Pour off the soaking water and continue to wash, agitating the grains, in several changes of water until the last washing runs clear.  Pour away the water, using the lid to help it drain and pour the four cups of water into the rice.  Let it stand for 10 more minutes.  

Cover the pan and place it over high heat.  Bring to a boil and immediately reduce the heat to low.  Simmer the rice for 30 minutes or until all the water is absorbed.  
Do not lift the lid while the rice is cooking, but remove it at the end of the cooking time to check if the water is absorbed.  If it is not, cover again and let it simmer for a few minutes longer.  

The rice is now ready 

2.  While the rice is cooking, rub the inside of a bowl liberally and thoroughly with shortening.  Arrange the "treasure" ingredients in a pattern, pressing them so they will adhere to the bottom of the bowl; place the nuts in the center and circle them with the red cherry slices.  Either arrange the remaining fruit in rings around the center or space them evenly in groups.
3.  When the rice is cooked and the moisture evaporated, take the pan off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons of shortening or margarine and 3 tablespoons of sugar.  Mix thoroughly.
4.  Carefully spoon half the rice into the bowl.  Try to avoid disturbing the fruit arrangement.  Gently compress it into an even and compact layer.
5.  Using the back of a tablespoon, make a shallow indentation in the center.  Place the Red Bean Paste in this and cover it with the remaining rice, pressing it down gently.
6.  Remove a tray from a steamer and place the bowl on it covering the pudding with a cloth.  Bring the steamer up to a boil and place the tray in it.  Steam the pudding for 1 hour.
7.  Toward the end of the steaming time, place the last 3 tablespoons of sugar in a small saucepan, together with the water.  Stir the cornstarch  and the cherry liquid together in a bowl.  Bring the sugar water to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.  Pour in the cornstarch mixture and stir until the sauce thickens.  Remove it from the heat.
8.  Remove the pudding from the steamer and gently slide a knife blade around the edge to loosen it.  Place a serving plate upside down over the top and invert the pudding, unmolding it onto the plate.
9.  Pour the sauce over the entire pudding and serve.

It is not traditional, but the author of this dessert suggests the addition of 2 or 3 slices of fresh ginger root, removing them before pouring the sauce over the pudding.

Advance Preparation and Storage Notes:  The pudding can be made ahead through step 6.  Do not unmold.  Reheat it by steaming it for 5-10 minutes.  Then make the sauce and finish the recipe.

Emeril's Stuffed Cornbread

INGREDIENTS:

- 1/2 lb. bacon, chopped
- 1 1/2 cups fresh corn kernels
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
- 2 teaspoons unsalted butter
- 3 tablespoons water
- 1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 2 eggs, slightly beaten
- 1 1/2 cups buttermilk
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 2 jalapeno chiles, seeded and chopped
- 1 3/4 cups sharp cheddar cheese, grated


METHOD:

Preheat oven to 375F.  Place a 10" cast iron skillet in the oven to get hot.

Return skillet to medium-high heat and add the corn.  Cook, stirring, until golden and tender, about 5 minutes.

Add the cream, butter, 1/4 teaspoon salt and water and cook until thick and creamy, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and mash with a potato masher to crush some of the corn.  Let cool.

In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, remaining salt and cayenne.  Stir.

In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well.  In a separate bowl, combine the cooled cream corn, bacon, jalapenos and 1 1/2 cups of the cheese; mix well.

Remove the cast-iron skillet from the oven and add the remaining tablespoon of the melted butter, tilting the skillet to coat the bottom and sides.  Pour half of the batter into the bottom of the skillet.  Top with the corn-cheese mixture, then top with the remaining half of the batter.

Bake until golden brown and set, about 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup cheese.  Serve hot.

Enchilada Sauce

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Active Time:  20 Minutes
Total Time:  1 Hour 50 Minutes
Yield:  Makes 4 cups
The Diner is the best place for breakfast in Yountville, CA. Owner Kaaren Gann serves this enchilada sauce with her huevos rancheros.
RECIPE INGREDIENTS
4 ounces whole dried pasilla chili peppers or 2 ounces pasillas combined with 2 ounces New Mexican or anchos*
4 cups water
1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
3 tablespoons corn oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
4 medium cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
One-14.5 ounce can tomatoes, drained and chopped
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 corn tortilla, cut into shreds
1 teaspoon salt or to taste
Other necessary recipes:
Huevos Rancheros
DIRECTIONS
With scissors, cut off chili stems, slice them open lengthwise and discard the seeds. Cut the chili in half and set them in a bowl.

Bring the water and vinegar to a boil, pour over the chilies and steep them for 30 minutes until softened.

In a 4-quart heavy saucepan over high heat add the oil. Add the onion and sauté, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Add the sesame seeds and garlic and sauté for a minute, stirring or until the sesame seeds begin to turn color. Stir in ground cloves and cinnamon, then immediately add the tomatoes, along with the chilies and the water and vinegar in which they were steeping. Bring the liquid to a simmer, cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. Stir in the cocoa powder and corn tortilla and remove from the heat. Cool for 30 minutes.

In a blender, in batches, puree the sauce until smooth. Season with salt to taste.

* The flavor and amount of "heat" depends on the type of chili peppers you use and if you have sensitive skin, handle the chili peppers with surgical gloves. The Diner uses only pasilla chili peppers in their sauce, but if you like your sauce a bit less fiery, mix the pasillas with milder New Mexican or ancho peppers.

Fire Dried Nuts

INGREDIENTS:

- 1/2 lb. walnuts, or pecans - perfect halves if possible
- 2 teaspoons corn oil
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar


METHOD:

Put the nuts in a heatproof bowl.  Cover with boiling water, then soak for 30 minutes.  Drain, pat dry and spread evenly on a large sheet pan lined with paper towels.  Dry for 30 minutes in the middle of a preheated 300F oven.  Turn the tray and reduce the heat to 250F, checking at 10 minute intervals.  Remove the nuts from the oven when they are almost entirely dry.  Test nuts from several spots on the tray to be sure.  Put the nuts into a shallow bowl to cool, stirring occasionally.  

Heat a wok or heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot.  Add the oil and swirl to coat, then add the nuts.  Stir gently with a wooden spoon until they are evenly glossed with oil and feel warm to the touch.  Lower the heat immediately if the nuts begin to scorch.

Sprinkle the salt over the nuts, stir gently to mix then slowly sprinkle in the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, until you have a sweetness to suit you.  The taste should be lively and sweet, with a hint of salt.  Stir constantly while adding the sugar and break off any caramelized bits that cling to the spoon, stirring them back into the nuts when you are done.  The whole process will take about 3-4 minutes, and the sugar and salt will melt and adhere to the nuts.  Serve hot or cool.

Fortune Cookies

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Fortune cookies can be tricky to make - it's important to make sure that the cookie batter is spread out evenly on the baking sheet. Instead of using the back of a wooden spoon to spread the batter, it's better to gently tilt the baking sheet back and forth as needed. Wearing cotton gloves makes it easier to handle and shape the hot cookies. This fortune cookie recipe makes about 10 cookies.
Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 15 minutes

Ingredients:

2 large egg whites
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
8 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoons granulated sugar
3 teaspoons water
Preparation:

1. Write fortunes on pieces of paper that are 3 1/2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease 2 9-X-13 inch baking sheets. 

2. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the egg white, vanilla extract, almond extract and vegetable oil until frothy, but not stiff.
3. Sift the flour, cornstarch, salt and sugar into a separate bowl. Stir the water into the flour mixture.

4. Add the flour into the egg white mixture and stir until you have a smooth batter. The batter should not be runny, but should drop easily off a wooden spoon.
Note: if you want to dye the fortune cookies, add the food coloring at this point, stirring it into the batter. For example, I used 1/2 teaspoon green food coloring to make green fortune cookies.

5. Place level tablespoons of batter onto the cookie sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart. Gently tilt the baking sheet back and forth and from side to side so that each tablespoon of batter forms into a circle 4 inches in diameter.

6. Bake until the outer 1/2-inch of each cookie turns golden brown and they are easy to remove from the baking sheet with a spatula (14 - 15 minutes).

7. Working quickly, remove the cookie with a spatula and flip it over in your hand. Place a fortune in the middle of a cookie. To form the fortune cookie shape, fold the cookie in half, then gently pull the edges downward over the rim of a glass, wooden spoon or the edge of a muffin tin. Place the finished cookie in the cup of the muffin tin so that it keeps its shape. Continue with the rest of the cookies.

Serving Ideas : Serve with French baquette or crackers.NOTES : This recipe will forever remind me of our good friend, Francis Risdon, who died at a much too young age of cancer.  Everyone loved Francis and she loved us all.  When I think of Francis, I think of two things:  she played flute in the Spokane Symphony Orchestra and she played just like the most melodic of birds; and her wonderful reputation of cooking hords of great food.  There was nothing greater than piling into Francis's home with a bunch of other musicians to enjoy some of the very best cooking in Spokane...hers!  This so simple and so fabulous.  I've always called it "Francis's Cheeseball"!  It never fails me...neither did she.  Love to her.

Preheat oven to 325F.   Take eggs out of the frig and bring to room temperature.

 
Place hazelnuts in oven to toast, about 7-8 minutes, until smelling good!  Remove nuts from oven; pour into towel on board; roll up and move the mixture back and forth with hands over towel.  This remove most of the skin on the nuts so that it doesn't fall off and  transfer into the food you are making.  Pick out nuts as the skins come off and continue rolling until most of the skin is removed.

Butter a 9" springform pan.  Combine crumbs and sugar.  Stir in butter and press into the bottom of the pan and about 1" up the sides.  Bake about 7 minutes.  Cool on rack.  Leave oven on.  Place a pan of hot water on the bottom shelf of the oven.  Place the oven rack that the cheesecake will bake on, at the midway point of the oven.

Filling:  With an electric mixer, beat cream cheese until smooth.  Gradually add sugar and add eggs one at a time.  Blend in Frangelico and vanilla.  Sprinkle the half of the chocolate chips and half of the nuts onto the bottom of the crust.  Spoon in filling.  Top with remaining chocolate chips and hazelnuts.  Bake the cheesecake until golden brown about 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Cool completely.  Place in refrigerator.

Topping: Beat the cream, sugar and coffee powder until fluffy with peaks.  Top the cheesecake just before serving.

French Chocolate Mint Truffles

INGREDIENTS:

- 6 ounces semisweet chocolate*
- *Choose good chocolate: Barton's
- Bittersweet, Tobler Tradition,
- Lindt Excellence for bittersweet or
- Bakers Semisweet, Baker's German's
- Sweet or Maillard's Eagle Sweet


METHOD:

Break or chop the chocolate into medium size pieces.  Place it in the top of a small double boiler over hot water on low heat.  Cover and let stand until partially melted.  Uncover and stir until completely melted.

Remove the top of the double boiler temporarily.  Add the butter a few pieces at a time and stir with a small wire shisk after each addition until smooth.

In a small bowl stir a bit of the chocolate into the yolks and then stir the yolks into the chocolate.

Replace over the hot water on low heat and stir gently with a rubber spatula for about 2 minutes.

Now remove the top of the double boiler.  Stir in the peppermint extract (or other liquior or flavoring), adding just a few drops at a time.  Taste it...make it as minty as you like, but add it slowly and taste it carefully.  Some mint extracts taste unpleasant if you use too much.  

Place the top of the double boiler in a bowl of ice and water.  Stir constantly with a small wooden spatula until the mixture is firm enough to hold a definite shape.

Place a piece of wax pper in front of you.  Use a slightly rounded teaspoonful of the mixture for each truffle.  Place them in mounds on the wax paper, forming 20 mounds.

If the mixture is firm enough, the truffles may be rolled into shape immediately.  But if it is too soft, let it stand uncovered at room temperature for about half an hour or until firm enough to handle.  

Spread out two more large pieces of wax paper.  Onto one, strain a generous amount of unsweetened cocoa.  Coat the palms of your hands well with the cocoa.

Pick up a mound of the chocolate mixture, roll it between your hands to form an uneven ball , then roll it around in the cocoa and place it on the other piece of wax paper.  Continue to shape all of the truffles, coating your hands with coco before shaping each truffle.

Let the truffles stand overnight at room temperature, uncovered or loosely covered so the outsides dry a bit.

The 2 ounces of additional chocolate must be ground to a fine powder in a food processor.  Spread the ground chocolate on wax paper and roll the truffles around in it to coat them again. 

These are best when they are very fresh, before they dry out too much and while they are still creamy soft in the centers.  They may be kept at room temperature for a day or two but they should be refrigerated or frozen for longer storage (bring back to room temperature before serving.

Beat the egg yolks and salt until blended.  Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar and beat with mixer for 4-6 minutes until mixture is pale yellow.  Whisk in rum and vanilla.  Gradually whisk the egg yolk mixture into the chocolate mixture.

In a large CLEAN bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with electric mixer  at low speed until foamy.  Increase the mixer speed to medium high and continue beating until whites become opaque and form soft mounds in the bowl.

Stir one third of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate batter.  Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in remaining egg whites just until blended.

Spoon the batter into prepared pan.Bake for 25-35 minutes until cake appears puffy and firm.  The cake should be moist but not liquid in the center.  A skewer inserted into the cake should not come out clean.

Remove cake from oven and cool on wire rack for a few minutes.  It will fall, as it should.  Remove the sides of the pan and serve warm or at room temperature.

French Crepes

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 1/2 cups AP flour*
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 large eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 6 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled


METHOD:

Mix together ingredients in a food processor and allow to rest for at least 30-60 minutes.

Heat a crepe pan or small 8" saute pan.  Place a little butter or pan spray in the pan.  With a 1/4 cup measuring cup or 1/4 cup ladle, place batter in hot pan and move all around the pan with a circular movement of the wrist while holding the pan's handle.  Allow to cook briefly, about 1 minute until slightly brown.  With a very thin, long spatula (offset spatula), place under the crepe and turn over gently.  Allow to cook about 30 seconds longer (until the crepe moves when you shake the pan), and then pour out onto a slightly warmed plate.  Continue with this process, piling the crepes upon one another, until all the batter is used up.

Within an hour, keeping the crepes at room temperature,  fill the crepes and sauce as desired.  

If you want to do this process ahead of serving, place a sheet of wax paper between each crepe and refrigerate until ready to use.

Fresh Pasta

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 large eggs
- 3 large egg yolks
- water or egg yolk, if needed


METHOD:

Pour flour into food processor.  Add salt.  Pulse to mix.

Mix the eggs and yolks in a bowl.  Add the olive oil to the eggs.  Pour this mixture into the food processor and pulse to mix.  The dough should almost come together.  Feel the dough between your fingers and it should hold together.  If not, add a couple sprinkles of water or another egg yolk, depending on how much moisture it needs.  (Usually water will do.)  Remove the dough from the food processor and gather up into a flat disk.  Cover with a bowl on the bread board.

Allow dough to relax (you, too, with a glass of wine), covered (not you, the dough....finish this before you sit down with the wine), for about 20 minutes (or longer if you have two glasses of wine).

Pass through a pasta maker by cutting it first in fourths.  Then flour slightly and place through #1 going in opposite directions 2-3 times until smooth.  Then continue to pass through each number on the pasta machine (flouring slightly between each number) until desired thinness is reached.  Usually this is about at #6 or #7.  Use in disired shapes.

Fresh Unsweetened Coconut Cream & Milk

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Take a fresh coconut (should be heavy and should slosh when shaken).  Place a Phillips screwdriver, place on two eyes (one at a time)of the coconut and hit
with a hammer, punching a hole.  Save if you wish, for drinking or pickling juice.

  Place the coconut in a 375F oven and bake for 20 minutes.  Remove and allow to cool to room temperature.

 Lay the coconut on a hard cement surface and strike with a hammer, cracking open the coconut.  Break into 4-5 pieces.  

 With a dish towel in hand, hold a piece of the coconut and remove the meat with a screwdriver.

  With a vegetable peeler, remove the outer thin, dark skin.

 Cut into 1-2 inch chunks and place in a heavy-duty food processor, using a steel blade.

  Grind for 30-60 seconds.  Scrape down sides and pulse and blend until coconut turns to pulp.

  Add 1 cup warm water and process for 30 seconds.  

Transfer to a large mixing bowl and "milk" the coconut by massaging and squeezing the meat at least "eighty-nine" times!  (Thai ritual)

Place a fine mesh strainer over another large mixing bowl and pour the coconut cream and meat into the strainer.  Press firmly to extract the liquid from the pulp.

Refrigerate for at least an hour and then skim off the thick cream into a plastic container and refrigerate (or freeze).

Put eh coconut pulp back into the first bowl and pour 3 cups of warm waater over.  Massage and squeeze another 89 times.  Again, strain, as before and refrigerate another hour.  Skim off the cream and combine with thick cream extracted from the first batch.  Pour the thin whey into a separate container and refrigerate until ready for use.

- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten with 1 teasp. salt
- 1 cup fine, dry unflavorred bread crumbs, spread on a dish
- vegetable oil, 1/2 " deep in pan

Put the vegetables, vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt in saucepan with 6 cups of water and bring to boil.

Drop in the brain (plunk) and when the water has returned to a boil cover the pan and adjust the heat so that the liquid bubbles very slowly but steadily.  Cook for 20 minutes.

Drain, and let the brain cool completely.  When cool, refrigerate for about 10 minutes, or until they are very firm. (You may prepare them ahead of time, and refrigerate until shortly before you are ready to fry.  Cover if refrigerating for several hours.)

Cut the brain into broad, large than bite size pieces, about 1/2 inch thick.

Dip the slices in egg, letting excess flow back into the bowl, then turn them in bread crumbs.

Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat.  When the oil is very hot, slip the coated lices into the pan.  Fry until goldn brown on one side, then do the other side.  When a nice crust ha formed on both sides, transfer to paper towels to drain. When all the slices are done, serve immediately, with lemon wedges on the side.

Fried Chicken....Back to the Fifties!

INGREDIENTS:

- 12 pieces cut-up chicken pieces, cut the thigh and leg apart and the breast in half across the bone.
- 1 cup buttermilk
- salt and pepper
- 2 cups AP flour
- 3 cups vegetable shortening


METHOD:

Cover chicken with buttermilk and salt and pepper.  Allow to marinate in refrigerator for 2-12 hours.

Place flour in double paper bag and shake chicken pieces in the flour a few at a time.

Meanwhile have a large fry pan (ideally a cast iron pan) warming on the stove with the shortening in it.  The shortening, when melted, should be at about 1/2" deep.  Take the shortening to a temperature of 350F before adding chicken.

When the melted shortening is hot enough, place the chicken pieces into the oil skin side down.  While cooking, the temperature of the oil should hold between 250-300F.  Cover the chicken with a lid.  Check in 5 minutes and rearrange the chicken pieces if some are cooking faster than others. Cover and continue to cook about another 5 minutes until the pieces are golden brown.  Turn the chicken pieces over and allow to continue to cook without a lid until the chicken is browned all over for about 12 minutes longer. 

Remove the chicken from the pan and place on wire rack to drain a few minutes over sheet pan.

Fruited Stuffing

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 cups dry bread cubes
- 1 whole onion, cut in small dice
- 2 celery stocks, small dice
- 1 leek, if I have it, small dice
- 1 clove garlic, smashed and minced
- 1 red apple or pear, skin on, small dice
- 1 green apple or pear, skin on, small dice
- handful raisins (if on hand, so to speak)
- handful chopped walnuts or pecans
- fresh chopped sage, about 5 leaves or so
- fresh thyme leaves removed from about 5 stems
- 1/4 cup parsley, chopped
- cool chicken stock to moisten
- brandy to moisten (optional)
- salt and pepper, to taste


METHOD:

1.  Cut the bread into 1/2" cubes (like for croutons) and spread out on cookie sheet.  Place in 200F oven for about 1/2 hour to dry out, stirring occasionally.  This step can be omitted and your stuffing can be made with bread without drying out...it will still be delicious.
2.  Place the onion in a saute pan and sweat in a small amount of butter or chicken stock (over using fat) a few minutes with celery, leek and garlic. 
3. Place the bread cubes in a large bowl.  Add the sweated vegetables, apples or pears, raisins, nuts, sage, thyme, parsley. 
4.  Moisten with cool chicken stock (not hot as we don't want the mixture going into the
bird to be warm) and brandy if desired.  Keep in mind that the apples or pears will cook and help to moisten the dressing.
5.  Salt and pepper to taste and TASTE before stuffing the bird.  You will have more than a chicken can hold.  Place the remainder in a small buttered cassarole and bake with your chicken....you'll have lots of stuffing that way!

NOTES:

NOTES : This is a wonderful all-purpose stuffing.  Change it by taking away the apples, raisins, nuts and adding sausage if you like (be sure to cook crumbled sausage with the onions first and cool mixture before stuffing bird)....Or you can just have the stuffing without the fruit as it is and it will still be delicious.  The point is, if you want to make stuffing, look at what ingredients you DO  have and go from there.  This is good for stuffing all poultry dishes....or how about stuffing onions or other vegetables and baking???   This is great with pork too....Use your creativity!

Genoise

INGREDIENTS:

- 5 large eggs
- 1/2 cup sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup flour, sifted
- 1/2 cup cornstarch, sifted
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 teaspoon vanilla


METHOD:

Coat the bottom of a springform pan (8 or 9 inches) with a little melted butter and place parchment or wax paper cut to fit the bottom of the pan.  Butter and flour the parchment paper and sides of pan.  Shake the excess flour out.

Melt the butter in a little bowl until it is liquid but NOT HOT, set aside in a warm place.  Add vanilla to this mixture.

Put the whole eggs, sugar and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer, place over hot water  in a double boiler and heat until it is almost too hot to touch the outside of the bowl, mixing constantly.  WATCH OUT you don't scramble.  When the bowl is almost too hot to touch, move the mixture to the mixer and continue mixing until you are  able to make a ribbon design on the surface of the batter.

After sifting the flour and cornstarch, mix together in a small bowl.  Gently fold in 1/3 of the flour/cornstarch mixture by scattering it over the surface of the batter.  Put about a cup of batter in the melted butter and mix well.  Add another 1/3 of the flour and fold again; add the butter/batter mixture, the rest of the flour and fold again.  Pour the finished batter into the prepared cake pan.  Bake in a preheated 350 oven for about 35 minutes.

Greek-Style Grilled Leg of Lamb

INGREDIENTS:

- 6 large garlic cloves
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon fresh black pepper, ground
- 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
- 7 pounds bone-in leg of lamb*, leaving a thin layer of fat


METHOD:

Mash the garlic with the salt to make a paste.  Mix together the paste, oil, lemon zest and juice, thyme, pepper and allspice.  Place lamb in ceramic dish.  With a pairing knife, make 1 1/2" slits (2" deep) all over the leg of lamb.  Reserve enough seasoning mixture to rub all over the lamb and push the rest into these slits.  Marinate lamb in the refrigerator all day or over night.  

Prepare the charcoal grill for indirect heat cooking over medium-high cooking.*  When the grill is ready, oil grill rack.  Place lamb over the spot where there are no coals and place the lid on top.  Cook until lamb temperature reaches 125F-130F for medium rare, about 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours.  To maintain heat, add about 2 cups of coals every 15 minutes.  Allow lamb to rest on heated platter, covered, at least 15 minutes before carving.


*Open vents on bottom of grill.  Light a large chimney starter full of charcoal.  When coals are lit, dump them along one side of the grill bottom, leaving about half of the grill free from charcoal.  When the charcoal turns grayish white (after about 15 minutes), the coals will be at it's hottest and begin to cool off.  Because in this recipe you want to hold the coals at a medium-hot stage for the duration of the cooking period (can hold your hand over the coals 3-4 seconds).  Check periodically to be sure coals are hot and add more charcoal every 15 minutes or so throughout the cooking period.

Make Spicy Chile Verde: Peel paper-like covering off of tomatillos.  Place tomatillos, chiles and onion on grill and grill all sides until slightly blackened all around.  Meanwhile, cook the bacon until crisp.  Pour bacon fat out of pan and put pan aside without cleaning. Put tomatillos, chiles, garlic, onion, cooked bacon and cilantro into food processor  and mix with chicken stock or water (will need to be done in batches).  Place in bacon saute pan and cook about 20 minutes adding more chicken stock to thin if necessary.  Sauce should be slightly chunky.

Cover the chicken breasts with olive oil (don't place oil in grill pan) and sprinkle with about 1- 2 teaspoons of the Spice Mixture on the skin side.  When the grill is quite hot place the skin side down on the grill pan and mark and grill for about 4-5 minutes.  Sprinkle the unseasoned side with more seasoning.  Turn and cook remaining side for about 2 minutes.  Turn the heat down to medium and continue cooking for another 6-7 minutes until chicken is cooked through but not dry.  Remove to warm plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm and allow the juices to return to the center of the breast.  Serve with sauce, rice and salad.  Fabulous!

Grilled Flat Bread

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 package active dry yeast
- 2 1/3 warm water
- 1 2/3 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 1/2 cups all purpose flour, approximately
- 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano, crumbled
- 3/4 cup Italian parsley, minced
- kosher salt


METHOD:

Activate the yeast in 1 2/3 cups of the warm water in a large bowl of an electric mixer.  Allow to stand for about 5 minutes.  Gently mix in on low  speed the whole wheat flour, the remaining 2/3 cup water, salt, and the olive oil.   Add 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and beat on low speed until the ingredients are moistened.  Increase the speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes or until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.  

Change mixer to dough hook (or continue by hand and knead) and slowly add in 3 cups of the remaining all purpose flour.  Knead with dough hook or by hand for about 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth, adding a little more flour, if necessary, to keep the dough from being sticky.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease the top.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to stand until doubled, about 1 1/2 - 2 hours.  

Turn the dough out onto a lightly flored surface and knead it briefly.  Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces.  Work with one piece of dough at a time, keeping the remaining pieces tightly covered.  

On a floured surface, roll each piece of dought into a ball and then roll the ball into a 10 inch circle with a rolling pin.  Brush one side with about 1 tablespoon of the extra virgin olive oil, then sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the oregano, 1 tablespoon of the parsley and korsher salt to taste, lightly pressing the seasoning into dough.  Turn the dough over onto a piece of aluminum foil and repeat brushing with olive oil and seasoning on the other side.  

Place the dough round, foil side down, on a baking sheet.  Repeat the rolling and seasoning with the remaining dough pieces, stacking the rounds on top of one another separated by the foil.  If not grilling (or baking) immediately, cover and refrigerate for up to 3 hours.

Preheat a charcoal grill.  When the coals are covered with gray ash, spread them into an even layer.  Set the grid about 3-4 inces above the coals for medium-high heat.  Using the foil to assist, fllip one round of bread onto the grid and peel off the foil.  Grill for about 2-3 minutes per side, turning once with a spatula, until the bread is lightly flecked with brown on both sides.

To grill in the oven, preheat the oven to 450F.  Set the oven rack at the lowest position.  Flip 2 bread rounds onto the hot rack and bake for 5 minutes; turn and bake 3 minutes longer.  Repeat with the remaining rounds.

Grilled Pork Chops

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 Pork Chop


METHOD:

1.  Turn on oven and grill as soon as arriving to kitchen.

2.  Mark (pg 237, Gisslen, for marking procedure, keeping in mind that only marking, and finishing in oven)  Pork Chop in diamond shapes on both sides. 

3.  Place in oven to finish to medium done...maybe 10 minutes??  Temperature should read about 120-130 for further cooking on plate to 150.  Some slight pink should still be visable upon cutting open.

4. Select small sauce to finish.

              Small Sauce = 1 qt. Demiglaze (the reduction of 1 qt. brown sauce and 1 qt. brown stock, reduce one half)  with added reduction of choice.

5.  Good choice of small sauce was Marsala:  Not classical recipe but Chef Klaus recommends that a little shallot, wine reduction take place before adding demiglaze.

Kristen and Charlotte's Marsala Small Sauce:  1 Tbsp. shallots cooked briefly in butter; deglazed with Marsala wine; 1 C demiglaze added and reduced to correct consistency (not too runny, so as to remain under pork chop on plate); season with s/p to taste.

Grilled Salmon Burritos

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

A former sandlot quarterback from Rockland County, New York, 6-foot-4-inch. Alan Harding, the chef and owner of Brooklyn's Patois, was inspired by the breakfast burrito that Madden ate at his first tailgate. It met Madden's two rules for tailgate food: it was a jumble of ingredients, and it was spicy. Harding's version has his hot-smoked salmon, apples and chipotles. In classic tailgating fashion, he did most of the prep work at home, then finished the dish on the grill before the game. If you're using an outdoor grill, throw some soaked hardwood chips on the fire and close the lid so that the smoke flavors the fish as it cooks.
RECIPE INGREDIENTS
For Fillings:
1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
1 cup cooked white rice
1 cup cooked drained black beans
2 ripe Hass avocados
2-1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
Salt and freshly ground pepper
3 medium red onions, thickly sliced
2 tablespoons pure olive oil, plus more for the grill
For Cream:
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup plain yogurt
2 tablespoons finely chopped canned chipotle chiles in adobo
For Salmon:
Six 6-ounce skinless salmon fillets
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander

Six 12-inch flour tortillas
DIRECTIONS
FOR FILLINGS: In a small saucepan of boiling water, cook the corn until tender, about 4 minutes; drain and let cool. Put the corn in a medium bowl and add the rice and beans. Halve the avocados and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Add the lime juice and mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and cover with plastic wrap.

In a small saucepan of boiling water, cook the corn until tender, about 4 minutes; drain and let cool. Put the corn in a medium bowl and add the rice and beans. Brush the onion slices with the 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the onions over a low fire for about 20 minutes, turning once, until nicely caramelized; transfer to a plate.

FOR CREAM: In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream, yogurt and chipotles.

FOR SALMON: Brush the grill or grill pan with oil. Season the salmon with the cumin,coriander and salt and pepper. Put the salmon on the grill and cover. Alternatively, arrange the fillets on the grill pan and cover tightly. Grill the fish over a low fire for 8 to 10 minutes, or until cooked through. Transfer the fish to a plate.

TO SERVE: Warm the tortillas on the grill for a few seconds, just until pliable. For each burrito, spread some of the grilled onions on a tortilla and top with a salmon fillet, some of the rice mixture and avocado and 2 heaping tablespoons of chipotle cream.

Grilled Salmon with Herby Vinaigrette

INGREDIENTS:

- 8 6 ounce portions salmon fillet, skinned, pin bones removed, cut into equal portions
- 3 tablespoons lemon vinaigrette
- fresh herbs: choose from chives,
- tarragon, chervil, dill, fennel ferns,
- mint....depending on your choice of fish.
- 8 tablespoons lemon vinaigrette


METHOD:

Heat a grill pan.  While the pan is heating, place the vinaigrette on both sides of the salmon.  Place the salmon on the hot grill at 10 o'clock position....the pan should sizzle.  Cook in this position for about 2 minutes.  Move the piece carefully on the same side to the 2 o'clock position and cook another 2 minutes.  The piece should be nicely marked on this side with a cross hatch.

Turn the salmon over and cook at the 10 o'clock position for about 2 minutes.  Again move to the 2 o'clock position and turn the fire down and cook until cooked through.  The salmon should remain pink inside.  The grill pan produces a crunchy outside with a succulent inside.  

While the salmon is finishing, add your selected herb(s) to the viniagrettte.  Whisk and taste to correct seasoning for your fish if necessary.  Place the cooked fish on the plate and top with about a tablespoon more per portion of vinaigrette and garnish with additional herb.

Make the salsa:  In a medium boil, combine the tomatoes, onion and cilantro.  Add the paprika mixture and stir to combine well.  Season to taste with salt and additional freshly ground pepper.  Refrigerate covered with plastic wrap until serving.

Raise the grill to the highest setting.  Brush the grill grate to insure it is clean (a top of the stove grill pan can be used here).
Moisten the chicken breast with about a 1/4 tsp. of olive oil each on both sides or spray the grill with non-stick spray.  Place the chicken breasts on the grill for about 5 minutes, cooking until golden.  Turn the chicken over and cover the pan with a lid.  Cook until done about 4-5 minutes (depending on the heat you can generate under the grill pan and the thickness of the breasts).  Transfer to clean plate and sprinkle with remaining lime juice.  Slice chicken into 1" pieces on the bias and finish at 350F for 5 minutes (this can also be accomplished on top of the stove on the grill)  

Serve with small mounds of salsa and garnish with cilantro.

2.  Combine the peppercorns, salt and vinegar in saucepan & reduce until nearly dry (au sec).  Remove from the heat and add cold water.

3.  To make it easier to beat with a wire whip, it is best now to transfer this diluted, cooled reduction to a stainless steel bowl.  Use a clean rubber spatula to make sure you transfer all the flavoring material to the bowl.

4.  Add the egg yolks to the bowl and beat well.

5.  Hold the bowl over a hotwater bath and continue to beat the yolks until they are thickened and creamy.

6.  Remove the bowl from the heat.  Using a ladle, slowly and gradually beat in the warm, clarified butter.  Add the butter drop by drop at first.  If the sauce becomes too thick to beat before all the butter is added, beat in a little of the lemon juice.

7.  When all the butter has been added, beat in lemon juice to taste and adjust seasoning with salt and cayenne.  If necessary thin the sauce with a few drops of warm water.

8.  Strain through cheesecloth and keep warm (not hot) for service.  Hold no longer than 1 1/2 hours.

Homemade Tofu Cheese

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Take fresh firm tofu and smear it with high quality miso and allow it to set three to five days in the refrigerator. The tofu absorbs the miso and 'sets up' like a soft cheese. When you remove the tofu from the fridge, scrape the miso off the tofu with a dinner knife. The excess miso can be used in again in a spread or dip. Cut the tofu in 'cheese' slices, or cube or use as a spread.SOURCE: Adapted from Ann Gentry

DIRECTIONS
Position rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. 

Generously coat a 9-by-5-inch (or similar size) loaf pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon oats in the pan. Tip the pan back and forth to coat the sides and bottom with oats; set aside another 1 tablespoon oats for garnishing the loaf.

Thoroughly stir together whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Using a fork, beat together the remaining 1 cup oats, yogurt, egg, oil and honey in a medium bowl until well blended. Stir in milk. Gently stir the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture just until thoroughly incorporated but not overmixed (excess mixing can cause toughening). Immediately scrape the batter into the pan, spreading evenly to the edges. Sprinkle the reserved 1 tablespoon oats over the top.

Bake the loaf until well browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. (It's normal for the top to crack). Let stand in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Run a table knife around and under the loaf to loosen it and turn it out onto the rack. Let cool until barely warm, about 45 minutes.

Not much help but I'll never, ever forget that sight, her all stylish in her little winter fur hat and coat with this big box heaved on top of her shoulder and wedged between the elevator door and the wall...I wasn't much help.)

Italian Garlic & Olive Oil Sauce

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Garlic and Oil Sauce aglio e olio
(Serves 5-7)
Although fairly high in fat, this backbone of Southern Italian cuisine is meant to be used sparingly, merely to coat pasta or vegetables. Be sure to allow the garlic to become only golden brown, never to scorch. Burnt garlic gives bitterness to cooked dishes. Add finely minced vegetables or onions to create new flavors.

3/4 cup olive oil
5 garlic cloves, minced
1/3 cup fresh, chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon white pepper

Heat olive oil in a frying pan for 2 minutes. Add garlic, and cook over low heat, stirring, until garlic is golden (not brown, which will taste terrible), about 3 minutes. Stir in parsley, oregano, and pepper. Cook and stir for one minute.

Italian Stuffed Pastries from the Marches

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

n the ranks of Italian filled sweet pastries the piconi marchigiani have a place of their own as dessert, breakfast food and treat for afternoon tea. In some versions the ricotta used for the filling is flavored with a little rum.
RECIPE INGREDIENTS
For Pastry:
4 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
5 egg yolks, beaten
1 cup butter; softened
1 1/4 cups sugar
Grated zest of lemon
For Filling:
3 egg yolks
1 1/4 cups sugar
Pinch of ground cinnamon
Grated zest of 1 lemon
1 cup rum
3 oz semisweet dark chocolate, grated
3 oz shelled almonds, ground
1 lb ricotta cheese

DIRECTIONS
FOR PASTRY: Heap the flour on a board and make a well in the center. Put in the egg yolks, butter, sugar and a little lemon zest. Knead quickly to obtain medium-soft dough. Roll into a ball, wrap in plastic and chill for 1 hour.

FOR FILLING: In a bowl, beat the egg yolks (reserving a little for brushing the pastries), sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest, rum, chocolate and almonds into the ricotta. The mixture should be thick.

Roll the dough out thinly. Cut into 3 in circles. Put 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center of each circle and fold the dough over into a half-moon shape, pressing with your fingers to seal the edges well. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Put the pastries onto a buttered baking sheet and brush them with the reserved beaten egg. Bake in the oven until a toothpick inserted into one of them comes out dry, about 20 minutes.

Italian Style Tuna Confit with Garden Beans

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 1/2 lbs. tuna steak, 1 1/2" thick
- thyme
- garlic cloves, crushed, unpeeled
- fennel seeds
- dried chile peppers

- 4 1/2 cups olive oil
- 1 1/2 lbs. fava beans, fresh
- 1 1/2 lbs. green beans
- 2 medium shallots
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- pepper
- Aioli*, *see Note


METHOD:

Season the tuna generously with salt and place in a deep bowl with thyme, garlic, fennel, dried peppers and peppercorns.  Cover with olive and refrigerate for several hours.  

When ready to cook, transfer all to a heavy bottomed non-reactive pot and heat slowly.  When the oil is warm, lower heat and continue cooking for 12-15 minutes.  Turn the fish over half way through.  It will be slightly pink in the middle when finsihed (take a peek with a pairing knive, just bending the flesh back a bit).

Remove the fish from the heat, and cool.  Reserve the oil.  After it has cooled it can be replaced in the oil and remain in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Cook the shelled fava beans (or any fresh shell beans) in water to cover by 1".  Add thyme, salt and a little olive oil.  Cook until tender.  Let the beans cool in their cooking liquid.

Blanch the green beans in boiling water for 2-3 minutes.  Plunge in ice water to cool.

Make a vinaigrette with the vinegar, shallots, salt and pepper.  Whisk in 1/2 cup of the confit oil.  Taste to correct balance and seasoning.

Drain the fava beans and toss with green beans with vinaigrette.  Arrange on plates with broken pieces of tuna over the top.  Serve with aioli on the side.

*Aioli:  Mash 3 cloves of garlic in a mortar with a little salt.  Take out 1/3 of the paste and set aside.  To the remaining garlic add 1 teaspoon water, 1/4 teaspoon salt and egg yolk, whisking.  Add 1 cup olive oil in a slow steady stream.  If too thick, add a bit more water.  Taste and add more garlic and salt.  Refrigerate and use the same day.

Melt the Hershey bars in the microwave.  Spread half the chocolate on the toffee with a rubber....ah, er...spatula.  Sprinkle on ground almonds.   Wait until chocolate and candy is hard ( a couple of hours).  Take candy out of cookie tray and turn over on waxed paper.  Spread with remaining chocolate and wait until hard.  Break into pieces (no testing allowed as it will never get to anyone as a gift).   Wow...wow...wowy.

NOTES:

NOTES : Rick Mathieu's mom has now literally spread this recipe far and wide...as here it is and she lives in California.

- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed ginger juice
- 2 tablespoons rice wine
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 1 cup canola oil

In another small bowl, combine ginger juice, rice wine, honey.  Mix and stir into the flour mixture, 1 spoonful at a time.  Knead lightly into a soft dough (but not too much maintaining the cookie's light and crunchy texture...like piecrust).

Form into balls the size of golf balls, making about 20 balls.  Use a cookie press to form an impression on the cookie.  On the underside, poke with a fork a few times  to help with even cooking.  

In a deep frying pan, heat the canola oil until very hot.  Drop the balls, 5-6 at a time, into the oil.  Fry for about 2 1/2 minutes, turning them once and fry for about 2 1/2 minutes more until golden brown and crispy.  Drain on paper towels.  Cool on a rack.  Transfer to a platter and sprinkle the cinnamon and pine nuts on top.

METHOD:

Lane Cake
Recipe adapted from The Gift of Southern Cooking by Edna Lewis and Scott Peacock

 
Photo: Marcus Nilsson
Lane cake is a traditional Southern holiday classic—white cake with lavish amounts of rich frosting made with pecans and fresh coconut.

This cake improves in flavor as it ages and mellows; make it up to 1 week before serving and keep it covered and uncut at room temperature. For better flavor, make homemade baking powder, which doesn't have the chemical aftertaste of store-bought baking powder: Triple-sift together 2 tablespoons cream of tartar and 1 tablespoon baking soda. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.

This recipe is from the Stirring Up Memories Christmas Menu.

Ingredients:Makes one 9-inch cake (12–16 servings)

Cake:

16 Tbsp. (2 sticks) unsalted butter , softened, plus more for pans
3 1/2 cups cake flour , plus more for pans
1 Tbsp. homemade baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1 cup milk , room temperature
1 tsp. vanilla extract
2 cups sugar
8 egg whites , room temperature
Filling:

8 Tbsp. (1 stick) unsalted butter
1 cup sugar
8 egg yolks
1 cup finely chopped pecans
1 cup finely chopped raisins
1 1/4 cups freshly grated coconut
1/4 cup bourbon or Tennessee whiskey
1 tsp. vanilla extract
To make cake: Preheat oven to 325°. Line the bottoms of three 9-inch cake pans with parchment paper; grease and flour parchment paper and sides of pans.

In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a glass measuring cup, combine milk and vanilla. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter on medium speed until creamy. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl. Reduce speed to low; add flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk-vanilla mixture. Mix until combined, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl.

Transfer batter to large bowl; wash and completely dry mixing bowl and beater attachments. In clean bowl of electric mixer, beat egg whites just until they form soft peaks. Stir one-third of the beaten whites into the batter to lighten; then, in two parts, gently fold in remaining egg whites.

Scrape batter into prepared pans; gently tap pans on counter to remove air pockets. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until cake springs back in center when lightly touched. Place pans on racks to cool 5 minutes; invert cake layers onto racks to cool completely (do not remove parchment paper).

To make filling: In a large nonreactive saucepan, melt butter over low heat; set aside to cool. Whisk in sugar and egg yolks until well blended. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula while also scraping bottom of pan, until mixture reaches 170° to 180° when measured with an instant-read thermometer and thickly coats back of spatula, about 10 minutes (make sure mixture does not simmer). Remove from heat and stir in pecans, raisins, coconut, bourbon, and vanilla. Refrigerate at least 2 hours, or until thickened and chilled.

To assemble the cake: Peel parchment off cake layers. Invert 1 layer onto a large cake plate. Top with about 1 cup filling, spreading filling to the edges of cake. Top with second cake layer and spread that layer with 1 cup filling. Repeat with final cake layer and remaining filling. Cool completely before serving.

Icing:  Cream butter and sugar thoroughly.  Mix in lemon juice, zest and liquor.  Consistency should be runny.  Spread on cake.

NOTES:

NOTES : This is one of my all time favorite cakes...It tastes wonderful when its hot, all light and lemony and it lightens a heavier winter meal.  It only tastes light...it is dense and delicious.  Serve it without icing and only with whipped cream, having refrigerated it.  Or serve it slightly warm with the icing and a small amount of whipped cream.  Its great for a coating of fresh berries or without icing but with homemade ice cream.  It is super...I've changed it slightly from a recipe from one of the Silver Palate books.  Enjoy.COOK'S TRICK...Buy a zester.  It is one of the greatest little tools you can own, not only for this recipe but for kazillions of other things you want to "zest" with a little lemon.  It looks pretty to zest things too!

Lemon Crumb Muffins

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

For the Streusel Topping:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sugar
4 tablespoons softened unsalted butter
For the Lemon Glaze:
6 tablespoons sugar
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
For the Muffins:
3 cups pastry flour
2 cups sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1 cup melted unsalted butter
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
zest from 3 fresh lemons

DIRECTIONS
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place two muffin molds, each with 6-muffin capacity, or one muffin mold with 12-cup capacity on a baking sheet.

FOR THE STREUSEL TOPPING: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and sugar. Add the butter, working with your fingertips, until the mixture resembles a medium crumb.

FOR THE LEMON GLAZE: In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and lemon juice until smooth and set aside.

TO MAKE THE MUFFINS: In a large bowl, sift the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt together. In another large bowl, whisk the eggs, sour cream, butter, lemon juice and zest together. By hand, gently mix the dry ingredients into the egg mixture. Be careful not to overwork the batter. If there are lumps, they will disappear during the baking. The less you work the batter, the more tender the muffins will be.

Fill the muffin molds with the batter. Sprinkle with the streusel topping and bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center or a muffin comes out clean. To prevent the muffins from getting soggy after baking, remove the cooked muffins from their mold and place them on a rack. With a skewer or toothpick, pierce 2/3 of the way into each warm muffin. Drizzle the lemon glaze over the muffins. Serve warm.

Lemon Curd

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp. sugar
- 1/2 cup lemon juice, freshly squeezed
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- pinch salt
- 1 lemons finely grated zest


METHOD:

Beat the yolks and sugar until well blended in a non-reactive saucepan.  Stir in the remaining ingredients except the lemon zest.

Cook over medium low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened.  It will thickly coat a wooden spoon but will remain liquid enough to pour when done.  As is cooks, the mixture will change from translucent to opaque and begin to take on a yellow color on the back of a wooden spoon.  Do not allow to boil.

After the curd has thickened, pour at once into another container passing through a strainer.   Press all except the course ending material through with the back of a spoon.  Discard the residue.  Stir in the lemon zest and cool.  Pour into an airtight container.  The curd will continue to thicken while chilling.

Lemon Ice Cream

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 1/8 cups strained fresh lemon juice, about 5 large lemons
- 2 cups sugar
- 4 cups half and half
- 2 pinches kosher salt


METHOD:

Scrub the lemons well and remove peelings from the lemons with a vegetable peeler.  Avoil the white pith.  Place two cups of sugar in the food processor.  Add the zest.

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 9" pie crusts
- 2 large pkg. lemon pudding and pie, (not instant)
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice


METHOD:

Follow pie filling directions on package except make filling in a double boiler.

Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.

While filling is cooling, make meringue.  Beat egg whites left from eggs used in filling mix and beat until stiff adding sugar to taste a little at a time.  Immediately fill shells with lemon filling and top with meringue being careful to pull meringue over to the crust, so as to attach it.  Place in 425 F oven and cook until golden brown, but watch carefully as it can burn easily.

NOTES:

Serving Ideas : This seems to be better when made two pies at a time!NOTES : Well, here we are with Eileen's famous Lemon Meringue Pie.  This is her most frequently requested item to bring to any function.  Now, one wouldn't think that a pie from a mix would be anything special and we could certainly duplicate such an effort without much trouble.  But, not so.  
My lemon pies never taste like this and sometimes they have a way of "bouncing" to the table.  But Eileen's special technique of cooking it in a double-boiler gently cooks it to the perfect consistency.  Then her addition of a little butter and lemon make it the best....so, I have hornswaggled her once again for our pleasure.  Now, you too, can dazzle your friends and people you wish to impress with your culinary skills with this wonderful pie!

Lemon Sour Cream Pound Cake

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Lemon-Sour Cream Pound Cake
Created Art Smith

 
Sour cream is the secret ingredient in many a pound cake. This one is based on a lemon pound cake recipe from my family's recipe collection.

Ingredients:Makes 12 servings

Cake

3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter , at room temperature
3 cups sugar
6 large eggs , at room temperature*
1 teaspoon vanilla
Grated zest of 2 lemons
1 cup sour cream , at room temperature
Lemon Syrup

1 cup fresh lemon juice
2/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
Zest of 1 lemon
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325°F. Butter and flour a 10-inch fluted tube (Bundt) pan, and tap out the excess flour.

Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a hand-held electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then the vanilla and zest. On low speed, add the flour in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions of the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour. Beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl often with a rubber spatula. Spread evenly in the pan.

Bake until a wooden skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours.

Bring the lemon juice, zest, water and sugar to a boil over high heat and cook until it is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes. Allow syrup to cool before drizzling onto the cake.

Transfer the cake to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. Drizzle half the syrup over the cake. Invert onto the rack and brush with the remaining syrup. Cool completely.

Recommended technique: If a recipe calls for room temperature eggs, place the uncracked eggs in a bowl of hot water for 5 minutes so they can lose their chill.

LOBSTER SAUCE:   For a lovely sauce, take the same recipe and puree everything, including the lobster.

LOBSTER BISQUE:  Any bisque must have rice to make it a bisque.  To the above, add or interchange with shrimp or crab.  Figure approximately 1C rice to 1 1/2 C liquid depending on desired thickness.  Add the rice at mirepoix point, adding, then, all the other ingredients except the tamalle (saving until the end as with original dish).  Puree all, even the rice.  Cut meat into brunoise, add to bisque and garnish with rice.

NOTES:

Serving Ideas : Serve with Rice Pilaf and baquette.NOTES : In 1980 when this dish was first cooked by French chefs and served at the White House, the menu was requested.  In the process of translating the French menu, it was thought that there must be a mistake with the name "Amororicaine" and was translated to "Americaine".  The different names are frequently used interchangeably, but actually translate to mean the same dish.

Lobster Bisque

INGREDIENTS:

- shells from lobsters*
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium carrot, small dice
- 2 stalks celery, small dice
- 12 shallots, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup brandy
- 1 cup Madeira
- 5 cups water
- 1 cup clam juice
- Beurre Manie:
- 1 tablespoon softened, unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 1/4 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
- dash hot pepper sauce, if desired
- lobster meat


METHOD:

*If your lobster is already shelled and you have no access to lobster shells, use about 2 pounds of shrimp shelled, saving the shells for this use and using the shrimp for another use (you can combine the shrimp and lobster in the bisque).

Saute the shells in the butter with the diced carrot, celery, shallots and garlic until vegetables are softened.  Add the brandy and Madeira and reduce by one half.  

Add the above mixture after reducing (boiling down) the alcohol mixed with vegetables and shells to half of the orginal volume, to the water and clam juice.  Cook together for approximately 45 minutes to one hour over a low heat.  This will pull the flavor from the shells.  

Blend this mixture in a blender or with a hand blender until blended as much as possible.  Pour through a strainer into a clean pot.  Bring back to a boil, lower heat and whisk in beurre manie.  Stir to thicken.  Strain again (yes, again).  Return to pot and add cream and lemon juice, and hot pepper sauce if desired. Add lobster, slowly heat through (without boiling).   Taste to correct seasoning.

METHOD:

Cut beef into 2" pieces.  Salt and pepper well.

Heat large braising pan.  Add olive oil to cover bottom.  Add seasoned meat and sear on all sides.  Take out of pan.  

Add onions, leeks, carrots.  Cook about 7 minutes until translucent and pickiing up fond (nummy scrummies) on the bottom of the pan.  Add tomatoes and garlic and cook another minute or two until fragrant.  

Add reduced wine and stock.  Add meat back in.  Add thyme, parsley stems and bay leaves.  Cover pan and place in a 375-400F oven.  Cook for about 1 1/2 hours.  

Remove from oven.  Take meat out of the sauce and strain sauce into another bowl.  Leave the (overcooked) vegetables behind.  Wipe out the pan.  Add the sauce back to the pan.  

Make a beurre manie by kneading the flour and butter together.  Whisk this mixture into the sauce until just slightly thickened (you may not need the entire amount).  Taste for seasoning and correct if necessary.  Add meat back into the sauce.

Some ways to serve:  At the very end, add fresh figs cut in half.  A very festive holiday preparation.  Or add seared crimini mushrooms.  The addition of caramelized onions is delicious.  Use your imagination.  This is a wonderful basic way to prepare a long-cooked beef.  Take it from here.

Turn heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until polenta starts to shrink from sides of pot...about 20-25 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add Parm.  Stir well.  Polenta should be creamy, but firm.

Move quickly so that the polenta does not set up and with a spoon or spatula, layer 2 cups of the polenta into the the cassarole dish.  Top with 1/3 cup of the pesto and helf of the sun-dried tomatoes.  Drizzle 1/2 cup of marinara over entire surface.  Top with another 1 1/2 cups of polenta and layer with the remaining pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and marinara.  Cover with another 1 1/2 cups of polenta.  Do not worry about smoothing the polenta...it will brown with more texture if it is left slightly uneven, with some of the tomato and pesto showing through.  Top with chunks of Brie.  At this point, you may cover the dish with plastic wrap, refrigerate, and hold up to 12 hours.  To serve, bring the dish to room temperature and bake in a 350F oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.  Then  set under broiler until top is golden brwon and crusty.

- 3 large eggs, beaten
- 1 3/4 cups water, or to correct consistency
- 3/4 cup whole wheat flour
- 3/4 cup flour
- salt to taste
- non-stick spray, for pan

- 16 ounces part-skim ricotta cheese
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese, grated
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon Italian parsley, chopped fine
- 1/2 cup Bechemel Sauce
- 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, finely grated
- 1/2 cup spinach, cooked and liquid squeezed out.
- 1 1/2 cups marinara sauce
- Parmesan cheese, grated for serving


METHOD:

Mix ingredients for the crepes in a food processor.  Allow to rest in the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes (or longer if more convenient).

Spray an 8" crepe pan with non-stick spray and place about 1/4 cup of the crepe batter into the hot pan.  Swirl the batter around to cover the pan.  Cook briefly until bubbles occur and turn over with a thin spatula and cook an additional 30-60 seconds.  Place on plate with wax paper or parchment paper between each one.

Mix together the ricotta, mozzarella, egg, parsley, Bechemel, spinach and a bit of the parmesan cheese.  Season with salt.

Use two oblong baking dishes.  Place about 1/4 cup of the marinera sauce in each pan and cover the bottom with a thin layer.  Place about a tablespoon of the filling into the crepe; roll to close and place in the baking dish, seam side down.  Do this with all the crepes, dividing the crepes between the two pans.  Allow plenty of room, not allowing them to touch.  Across each crepe, place 1 teaspoon of marinera.  Sprinkle with the rest of the left 1/4 cup parmesan.  Cover the baking dishes with aluminum foil and bake until the crepes become puffed...about 20-25 minutes.  Finish by taking off the foil and bake an addition couple of minutes to brown.  Serve with a sprinkle of fresh Parmesan cheese.

In separate small bowl, beat egg substitute on low speed for about 30 seconds until eggs begin to foam. Gradually sprinkle in remaining 2/3 cup sugar a little at a time, increasing mixer speed to medium as mixture thickens.  Beat 4-5 minutes in all, until eggs are very thick and soft peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into egg mixture and set aside.  At this point, microwave lime/gelatin for 20-30 seconds to warm and liquefy.  Fold about 3/4 cup of whipped egg mixture into lime/gelatin to lighten, then fold lime/gelatin back into egg mixture.

Spoon half the lime filling into graham cracker crust, making edges slightly higher than center of pie.  Reserve about 1/4 cup berry filling for pie surface and pour remaining berry filling into center, leaving 1" border of lime filling around outer edge.  Top with remaining lime filling and smoothe with metal spatula or similar tool.  Drop spoonfuls of reserved berry filling onto pie surface.  Using sweeping circular motions with the tip of a clean toothpick or chopstick, create a bequtiful swirling effect.  Refrigerate 4-6 hours until set.  Garnish with fresh lime slices and berries.

Martha's Versitile Cake

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

INGREDIENTS

• 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pans
• 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled), plus more for pans
• 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
• 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
• 1 teaspoon salt
• 1 1/2 cups sugar
• 2 large eggs plus 3 large egg yolks
• 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
• 1 cup low-fat buttermilk
Whipped frosting
• 3 large egg whites
• 3/4 cup sugar
• Pinch of salt
• 1/3 cup water
• 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
DIRECTIONS
Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour two 8-by-2-inch cake pans, tapping out excess flour. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. With mixer on low, beat in eggs and yolks, one at a time. Beat in vanilla. Alternately beat in flour mixture and buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour mixture; mix just until combined.

Divide batter between pans; smooth tops. Bake until cakes pull away from sides of pans, 32 to 35 minutes. Let cool in pans 10 minutes. Run a knife around edges of pans and invert cakes onto a wire rack. Let cool completely.

Place one cake, bottom side up, on a cake stand. Tuck strips of parchment paper underneath (see page 119). Using an offset-spatula or table knife, spread top with Whipped Frosting. Top with remaining cake; frost top, then sides. (Store unfrosted cakes at room temperature up to 1 day. Once frosted, serve within a few hours.)

Frosting: In a heatproof bowl set over (not in) a saucepan of simmering water, combine 3 large egg whites, 3/4 cup sugar, a pinch salt and 1/3 cup water. Cook over medium, stirring constantly, until sugar has dissolved (or mixture registers 150 on an instant-read thermometer), 2 to 3 minutes.

Transfer to a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat on medium-high until glossy, stiff peaks form (do not overbeat), about 3 minutes; reduce speed to low, add 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, and beat just until combined. Use immediately.

TIPS
Chocolate variation: In step 1, reduce flour to 2 cups and add ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder. Top frosted cake with shaved dark chocolate.

Lemon variation: In step 1, add 1 tablespoon lemon zest to flour mixture. In step 2, omit vanilla extract and beat in 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice with buttermilk.

While cakes are baking, bring ½ cup sugar and ½ cup water to a boil in a saucepan. Add 1 thinly sliced and seeded lemon and simmer 25 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer lemon slices to waxed-paper-lined plate. Stir ¼ cup fresh lemon juice into syrup.

Using a toothpick, poke holes in warm cakes on rack. Brush with lemon syrup. For frosting, substitute 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice for vanilla extract. Frost cooled cakes and top with candied lemon slices.

Mexican Killer Kahlua Chiffon Cake

INGREDIENTS:

- 1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa, Dutch processed
- 3/4 cup boiling water
- 1 3/4 cups sifted cake flour
- 1 3/4 cups superfine sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons walnut oil
- 2 tablespoons safflower oil
- 6 large eggs, separated
- 4 additional egg whites
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 1/4 teaspoons cream of tartar
- Kahlua Icing:
- 2 cups powdered sugar, softed
- 1/4 cup kahlua


METHOD:

Preheat the oven to 325F.

In a medium bowl combine the cocoa and boiling water and whisk until smooth.  Cool

In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar, baking powder and salt and beat 1 minute to mix.  Make a well in center.  Add the oils, egg yolks, chocolate mixture and vanilla and beat 1 minute or until smooth.

In another large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat until soft peaks form when the beater is raised.  Beat in the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and beat until stiff peaks form when the beater is raised slowly.  Fold 1 heaping cup of egg whites into the chocolate mixture with a large balloon wire whisk.  Gently fold in the remaining egg whites until just blended.

Pour into the tube pan (the batter will come to 1 3/4" from the top), run a small metal spatula or knife through the batter to prevent air pockets and bake for 60 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when lightly pressed in the center.  Invert the pan, placing the tube opening over the neck of a soda or wine bottle to suspend it well above the counter and cool the cake completely in the pan (about 1 1/2 hours).

Loosen the sides with a long metal spatula and remove the center core of the pan.  Dislodge the bottom and center corn with a metal spatula or tin sharp knife (A wire cake tester works well around the core.  To keep the sides attractive, press the spatula against the sides of the pan and avoid any up and down motion.)  Invert onto a greased wire rack and reinvert onto a serving plate.  Wrap airtight.

Icing:  Beat the kahlua into the powder sugar until smooth (more kahlua may be added for correct texture...should be runny enough to pour but not traslucent).

Pour over cake allowing to drip down sides.

Make Kahlua Cream Anglaise, serving cake on cream sauce.

Mile High Lemon Meringue Pie

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Mile-High Lemon Meringue Pie
Lemon meringue pie may be an American classic, but it can be tricky to prepare. There’s the crust with all its issues, then the tart filling and the meringue itself, which is all too prone to weeping. And that topping is never, ever as tall and fluffy as we would like. We wanted to figure out how to make a perfect lemon meringue pie with a sky-high topping. Here’s what we discovered:

Test Kitchen Discoveries

Make the meringue with a hot sugar syrup (what the professionals call Italian-style meringue). This ensures that the meringue is cooked through and stable enough to be piled high on top of the filling. The addition of a little cream of tartar to the egg whites while mixing also helps to stabilize the meringue.
Flavor the filling with both lemon zest and lemon juice for the brightest citrus flavor. Remember to strain the filling to remove the zest, which would mar the otherwise silky smooth filling.
Use a rubber spatula to spread the meringue over the filled pie, making sure to stick the meringue to the edge of the piecrust to prevent the topping from shrinking. Once all the meringue is on the pie, use the spatula to make the spikes and peaks of meringue.

Mocha-Nut Chiffon Cake

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 1 1/3 cups cake flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 7 large eggs, 2 left whole, 5 separated, at room temp.
- 2/3 cup coffee, espresso strength
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup walnuts, toasted, finely chopped
- 1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, grated
- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar


METHOD:

Adjust rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325F.  Whisk sugar, flour, baking powder, salt together in large bowl (at least 4 qt. size).  Whisk in two whole eggs, five egg yolks (reserve white), 3/4 cup coffee, oil, vanilla.  After mixed, add walnuts and baking chocolate.

Pour reserved egg whites into large bowl; beat at low speed with electric mixer until foamy, about 1 minute.  Add cream of tartar, gradually increase speed to medium-high, then beat whites until very thick and stiff, just short of dry, 9-10 minutes with handheld mixer and 5-7 minutes in standing mixer.  With large rubber spatula, fold whites into batter, smearing in any blobs of white that resist blending with flat side of spatula.

Pour batter into ungreased large tube pan (9-inch diameter, 16-cup capacity).  Rap pan against countertop five times to rupture any large air pockets.  If using two-piece pan, grasp on both sides with your hands while firmly pressing down on the tube with thumbs to keep batter from seeping underneath pan during this rapping process.  Wipe off any batter that may have dripped or splashed onto inside walls of pan with paper towel.

Bake cake until wire cake tester inserted in center comes out clean, 55-65 minutes.  Immediately turn cake upside down to cool.  If pan does not have prongs around rim for elevating cake, invert pan over bottle or funnel, inserted through tube.  Let cake hang until completely cool, about 2 hours.

To unmold, turn pan upright.  Run frosting spatula or thin knife around pan's circumference between cake and pan wall, always pressing against the pan.  Use cake tester to loosen cake from tube.  For one-piece pan, bag it on counter several times, then invert over serving plate.  For two-piece pan, grasp tube and lift cake out of pan.  If glazing the cake, use a fork or a paring knife to gently scrape all the crust off the cake.  Loosen cake from pan bottom with spatula or knife, then invert cake onto plate.  

Can be wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature 2 days or refrigerated 4 days.

Oat Bread

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 package active dry yeast
- 1 3/4 cups lukewarm water
- 1 1/2 cups steel cut oats, coarsely ground in food processor
- 2 cups unbleached white bread flour
- 1/2 tablespoon sea salt
- extra coarse oatmeal for sprinkling


METHOD:

Place yeast in 3/4 cup of the water and proof for 5 minutes until bubbly.  Place remaining cup water in bowl, add yeast water and oats and quickly mix to make thin, gritty, lump-free batter.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at warm room temperature for about 4 hours.  The mixture should become thick and spongy.

Work in the white flour and salt to make a soft, very slightly sticky dough.  It will feel rather more gluey than a white flour dough.  If the dough sticks to your hands or the bowl, add a little more flour.  If there are dry crumbs in the bowl or the dough feels stiff and dry, add a little more water.

Turn the dough out on to a work surface and knead thoroughly for 10 minutes.  Cover the dough with a sheet of plastic wrap and leave for 15 minutes.

Shape the dough into an oval loaf about 9 inches long and put onto the prepared baking sheet.  Put the sheet into a large plastic bag or cover lightly with a damp dish towel.  Leave to rise until almost doubled in size for 1-2 hours.

Twenty minutes before completion of rising (more or less), preheat the oven to 425F.

Sprinkle the top of the loaf with a little oat meal.  Then, using kitchen scissors, snip the top in a zig-zag pattern.  Bake for about 35 minutes until the loaf turns a light golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped underneath.  Cool on a wire rack.

Old-Fashioned Apple Tart

INGREDIENTS:

- Dough:
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold
- 3/4 cup all purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons ice-cold water
- Filling:
- 2 large Golden Delicious apple
- 2 tablespoons apricot jam
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter


METHOD:

Preheat oven to 400F.

Place the flour, salt and sugar in the food processor.  Add cut up butter and pulse gently.  Add water slowly and pulse gently being careful not to roll up in a ball.  Dump out on floured board.  Roll out into a 10" round.  Place on cookie sheet and place in refrigerator.

Meanwhile, peel the apples, cut them in half and remove the cores.  Hollow the apples out a little with a measuring spoon and chop the trimmings.  (You should have about 3/4 cup).  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the jam in the hollow of each apple half and arrange the halves, cut side down, in the center of the circle of dough.  Sprinkle the chopped apple around the halves.

Bring the edge of the dough up over the apples to create a border, 1-2 inces hight, around the edge.  (This will hold the cooking juices inside.)

Sprinkle the top of the tart with sugar and cinnamon and dot with butter,.  Bake at 400F for 45 -60 minutes, until well browned.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

Place the bowl in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Place in the refrigerator and allow to relax for 30 minutes.  Have a glass of wine.

Preheat the oven to 375F before shaping.

Divide the dough into 2 pieces.  Cover one piece with plastic wrap while shaping the first batch of crackers.  Press and roll the dough into a rectangle about the length of the baking sheet.  Roll the dough as thin as possible without tearing it apart.  With the help of the rolling pin, lift and transfer the thin sheet of dough to the baking sheet.  With a rolling pizza cutter  cut the dough into as many crackers as you desire.  Prick each cracker with the tines of a fork.  Repeat with the second piece of dough.  About 60 1" pieces can be cut from the dough (but you can make them any size you wish).

Place the baking sheet on the lower shelf of the oven and bak until light golden brown, about 10 minutes (it can take as long as 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the dough).    Cool on a metal rack.

Orange & Almond Cake Wedges

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 large seedless (best if navel) oranges
- 6 large eggs
- 1 1/2 ground almonds
- pinch of salt
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- Garnish: Thin slices of peeled orange
- sprinkled with confectioners' sugar
- and a touch of cinnamon. Serve with
- whipped cream.


METHOD:

Wash the oranges and boil them in water to cover, without peeling, until very soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain, cool, cut into quarters, and remove the seeds, if any.  Process the oranges to a fairly fine puree in a blender or food processor or by putting them through a meat grinder.  Don't make it too fine.  The little bits of skin, which will not be at all bitter after the long boiling, are pleasant to bit on.  Beat the eggs in a bowl until thick, then add the ground almonds, salt, sugar, baking powder and orange puree, and mix well.  Pour into a deep 9" cake pan that has been buttered and floured and bake in a 400F oven for 1 hour or longer, until firm to the touch when pressed with the tip of your finger.  Remove the pan to a rack, allow the cake to cool, then turn it out of the pan onto a serving dish.  Serve garnished with orange slices or berries and whipped cream.

NOTES:

NOTES : This cake has a moist and dense consistency.  Don't worry, it does not rise very much and it will eventually bake firm.  You can cut very small wedges and get 12 out of this cake.

- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 cup instant nonfat dry milk
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup dried or frozen cranberries
- 2 teaspoons orange extract

METHOD:

In a large mixing bowl whisk together the yeast, sugar,1/2 of the flour, salt and nonfat dry milk (this can be done with the paddle of the mixer).  Add the butter and mix slightly.  While the mixer is running, add the water and the extract.  Mix with the paddle until mixed.  Change to the dough hook.  Start the mixer and slowly add the rest of the flour, 1/2 cup at a time.  Continue to knead with the dough hook about 6-8 minutes more.  

Place the dough in an oiled bowl and roll around to cover dough with oil.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise until double in size about 45-60 minutes.  

Transfer from bowl and knead slightly.  Divide the dough into 16 balls.  

Place a 12" round Dutch oven over low heat for about 30 seconds.  Let the pot get just barely warm to the touch.  Do not let the bottom get hot.  Remove from the heat.  Coat the pot with cooking spray.

Arrange the balls of dough in the Dutch oven; they will touch.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the rolls double in size and do not readily spring back when poked with finger, at least 1 hour.

Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and heat the oven to 350F.

Cover the Dutch oven with its lid then bake the rolls for 30 minutes.  Remove the lid and continue to bake until the rolls are browned, about another 15 minutes.  Carefully remove the rolls from pot, cool and serve.

Orange Rolls

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 package yeast
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 1/4 cup milk, warmed
- 1/4 cup orange juice, room temp
- 1 large egg, room temp
- 3-3 1/2 cups flour
- 1/4 cup butter, room temp
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- zest of two oranges, divided in half
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/4 cup orange juice concentrate
- 2 tablespoons sugar


METHOD:

Place yeast in 1/2 cup warm water to dissolve and proof.  Wait 5 minutes until bubbly on top indicating the yeast is working.  While you are waiting, place all the dry ingredients,  butter and half of orange zest in the bowl of a heavy mixer. Mix briefly to combine the dry ingredients.  

 Warm the milk, briefly, in the microwave (not to hot...will kill the yeast).   Add the orange juice and egg and whisk with a fork to break up egg.  Add the bubbly yeast mixture to this mixture.  Place the dough hook on the mixer and turn on.  While the mixer is running, add the milk mixture all at once.  Mix on a moderate speed.  The dough hook will gather up all the flour around the edges within about 5 minutes.  Continue to knead another 6-7 minutes until the mixture feels slightly spongy to the touch.  Remove from the bowl and shape into a ball.  Place in a buttered bowl, moving the dough around the bowl in a ball to cover the entire ball with butter.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Place in a warm spot and allow to rise until doubled.  

Meanwhile, melt butter in small pan.  Add orange juice concentrate, 2 tablespoons sugar and second half of zest.  Put aside.

Butter two 8" cake pans or one rectangle baking pan with some of the butter/orange sauce.   When dough has risen, remove from bowl and divide into two pieces for 8" pans, or leave in one piece for rectangle pan.  Press into selected pan(s).  With sharp knife, cut into bun-size pieces.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise again.  When doubled (after about 45 minutes), brush with butter/orange sauce.  Place in a 350F oven for about 12-14 minutes until golden.SOURCE: Char Zyskowski

Oven BBQ Brisket

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Oven-Barbecued Beef Brisket
We love the rich flavor and tender texture of barbecued brisket, but grilling season is cruelly short in many regions of the country. What’s a cook to do when the craving strikes for brisket in midwinter and the temperatures are too low to make a low fire sustainable? We wanted to figure out how to attain that smoky flavor and tender texture indoors. Here’s what we discovered:

Test Kitchen Discoveries

Liberally season the meat with a spicy rub (see All-Purpose BBQ Rub) and poke it with a fork so that the spices’ flavors penetrate into the meat.
Wrap the brisket in bacon. As the bacon renders, it will bathe the brisket in smoky fat.
Bake the brisket slow and low sealed in aluminum foil. Containing the moisture released by the meat will help the meat cook faster and be more tender. In essence, the brisket is being braised in its own juices.
Use the smoky-tasting juices rendered by the brisket as the base for an accompanying sauce.SOURCE: Cooks Country

Parmesan Coated Fish with Walnut Romesco Sauce

INGREDIENTS:

- Romesco Sauce:
- 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 large garlic cloves
- 2 fresh green chilies, halved & seeded
- 1/3 cup chopped walnuts
- 3 ripe plum tomatoes, skins removed
- salt to taste
- freshly ground pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- Fish:
- 2 tablespoons flour
- salt to taste
- freshly ground pepper
- 1/2 tablespoon finely grated parmesan cheese,
- preferably Parmigiano-Reggiano
- 1/4 cup milk
- 4 6 oz. thick fish fillets (cod, haddock, monkfish
- or halibut), skins removed
- 1/4 stick butter
- 1 tablespoon oil
- flat leaf Italian parsley sprigs, for
- garnish


METHOD:

Sauce:
1.  Take good solid skillet and heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat.
2.  Lightly saute the whole garlic cloves for about 3 minutes or until they feel softened and have turned golden.
3.  Then add the chilies and walnuts and continue to cook for another 2 minutes.
4.  Put all the above into a food processor, returning the skillet to high heat.
5.  When the oil begins to smoke,cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise and place them into the hot pan cut-side-down.  Keep the heat high and cook the tomatoes until they are charred and blackened all over -- this will take about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes on each side.
6.  Next, add the tomatoes to the processor blender, turn it on to a low speed and add the rest of the oil in a slow, steady stream.  The sauce will then begin to thicken and assume the consistency of mayonnaise.
7.  Add salt and pepper to taste; transfer the sauce to a bowl and add balsamic vinegar.
8.  If you are going to serve this later, cover and refrigerate; but bring to room temperature before serving.

Fish:
1.  Mix the flour, seasoning and cheese together on a plate and pour the milk into a shallow dish.
2.  Wipe and dry the fish with paper towels.  
3.  Dip the fish into the milk and then into the flour mixture, making sure it's well coated and that you shake off any surplus.
4.  Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet and as soon as its really hot cook the fish for 2-3 minutes on each side, depending on its thickness.  The coating should be golden brown, and as soon as its cooked, remove the fillets carefully with a spatula to warm serving plates.
5.  Serve with a little sauce spooned over and garnish with the parsley.

Pepper and Salt Shrimp

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 lb. Medium shrimp, unshelled
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Shao Hsing rice cooking wine
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 cups vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic, finely minced
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 scallion, finely minced


METHOD:

Cut through the shrimp shells two-thirds of the lenght down the back of the shrimp.  Remove the legs and devein the shrimp, leaving the shells and tails on.  Pull off the sharp spine that is about 1/2" long between the soft tail fins.  Rinse the shrimp under cold water and set on several thicknesses of paper towels.  Pat the shrimp completely dry with more paper towels.  Because they are deep fried, they must be bone dry before cooking.

Place the shrimp in a medium bowl, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and the rice wine and toss to combine.  Set aside for about 10 minutes.  Do not allow the shrimp to sit for more than 10 minutes or the texture of the shrimp will be mushy.  Sprinkle the shrimp with cornstarch and toss until well combined.

In a heavy 9" wide, 4" high pot, heat oil over medium-high heat to 375F.  Carefully add the shrimp and cook 45 seconds to 1 minute, or just until shrimp turn bright orange.  Carefully remove shrimp with a slotted metal spoon to a platter lined with several thicknesses of paper towels.  Remove oil from heat and se aside to cool.

Heat a wok or skillet over hight heat until hot but not smoking.  Carefully add 1 tablespoon of the reserved hot oil to the wok along with the garlic and ginger, and stir fry 20-30 seconds, or until mixture just begins to turn brown.  Add the shrimp, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and crushed red pepper flakes, stir fry 1 minute or until shrimp are just cooked through.  Stir in the scallion and serve immediately.

- 3 large eggs
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 1/2 cups sifted cake flour
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 13 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened


METHOD:

Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour an 8"x2 1/2" loaf pan (4 cups) or any 6 cup loaf or fluted tube pan.

In a large mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients and mix on low speed for 30 seconds to blend.  Add the butter and half the egg mixture.  Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened.  Increase to medium speed and beat for 1 minute to aerate and develoop the cake's structure.

Scrape down sides.  Gradually add the remaining egg mixture in 2 batches, beating for 20 seconds after each addition to incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the structure.  Scrape down sides.

Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth surface with a spatula.  The batter will be almost 1/2" from the top of a 4 cup loaf pan.  Bake 55-65 minutes (or 35-45 minutes in a fluted tube pan) or until wooden skewer inserted in center comes out clean.  Cover loosely with buttered foil after 30 minutes to prevent overbrowning.  The cake should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven.

Let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes and invert it onto a greased wire rack.

Pork Barbeque Sandwiches

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 10-pound pork shoulders, with bone
- hickory chips & charcoal for grilling,
- 50:50 ratio
- 4 cups white wine vinegar
- 1 1/3 cups ketchup
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1 teaspoon cayenne
- 1 teaspoon coarse salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
- 30 hamburger buns, split
- Red Green Slaw


METHOD:

Preheat oven to 500F.
Wrap the pork shoulders in aluminum foil and place in a large heavy roasting pan.  Roast the pork shoulders for 20 minutes at 500 then reduce the heat to 250 and cook for an additional 5 hours, turining them every hour.

Using a covered grill, start the fire one hour before the pork shoulders are finished roasting, using the mixture of hickory chips and charcoal.  When the pork shoulders are roasted, remove the foil and transfer them to the grill.  Cover the grill and smoke the pork for 20-40 minutes.  
Allow the meat to cool so it can be handled, then transfer it to a large bowl.  Remove the meat from the bone and using your fingers, finely shred the meat.  
In a medium saucepan, mix together vinegar, ketchup, sugar, honey, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.  Simmer the sauce ingredients for 10 minutes over low heat.  Reserve 1 cup of sauce and pour the remaining sauce over the meat and toss until the meat is evenly coated.  Keep the meat warm in double boiler until ready to serve.
To serve, spoon a portion of meat onto the bottom of a soft bun, mound the Red Green Slaw on top of it, and pour a little of the remaining sauce over all, then top with the second half of the bun.
The meat can be made a day or two in advance and kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator.  To serve, reheat it in the top of a double boiler over simmering, not boiling, water.

Pork Braised in Milk

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 teaspoons unsalted butter
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 3 pound boneless pork loin
- 2 onions, thinly sliced
- 4 cups whole milk
- 4 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon + fresh thyme leaves
- 2 cloves garlic, cut in half
- salt & pepper to taste
- 2 pounds Granny Smith apple, peeled and quartered
- 2-4 tablespoons water
- sugar, to taste
- 1 large bunch watercress


METHOD:

Heat roasting pan, add butter and oil and brown pork loin all around.  Remove the pork.  Reduce the heat and add the onions, cooking until golden.  

Meanwhile heat the milk with 2 of the bay leaves until small bubbles have formed around the edges.  Cover and keep hot until ready to use. 

Mince the garlic and thyme together until combined.  Rub all over the pork and season with s/p.  Return to the pan with the onions.  Remove the bay leaves from the milk and pour the milk over the pork.  Add the remaining 2 bay leaves, cover and bring to a simmer.  Reduce the heat to maintain a slow simmer and cook until the  pork is tender but still slightly pink in the center (145F), about 1 hour.  Turn the pork occasionally to make sure it cooks evenly.

Meanwhile, place the apples in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons of water.  Cover, bring to a boil and then lower the heat to simmer.  Cook until the apples are tender but with some texture.  Add water if necessary to keep the apples from sticking.  This will turn into a chunky puree.  Season with sugar, if desired, and keep warm over very low heat.  

When the pork is cooked through, transfer to heated platter and cover with foil.  Remove the bay leaves and puree the onions and cooking liquid to a soup consistency.  Correct seasoning and serve as a first course.

Cut the pork into thick slices, line a warm platter with watercress, top with pork slices and surround with the apples.  Serve immediately.

Pork with Country Gravy

INGREDIENTS:

- 1/4 lb. bacon
- 1 pork tenderloin, pork chops are great too!
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or butter
- 1 large shallot
- 1 clove garlic, smashed and minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh sage, minced
- salt and pepper
- 4 tablespoons bacon fat (or fat from meat cooked, i.e.
- chicken, beef, sausage)
- 4 tablespoons flour
- 2 cups milk, warmed
- salt and pepper


METHOD:

Cook the bacon and render fat.  Put the bacon aside and pour off  all but 1 tablespoon of fat and reserve.  Place olive oil or butter in pan and add shallot, garlic and sage.  Add the pork tenderloin and sear.  Finish in 375F oven for about 12-15 minutes until internal temperature is at about 155.

Take out of oven.  Tent with aluminum foil on warm plate while you make the gravy.  

Place the rendered fat back into the pan (add enough butter to make 4 tablespoons total).  Add flour and make a roux.  Cook this roux at least 3-5 minutes until flour taste is cooked out....it will begin to smell a bit like cooked biscuits.  Take the roux off the fire and add the warmed milk.  Add a little at a time, not adding all at once to generate the correct consistency.  Cook until thickened.  Season with salt and pepper and return bacon bits to gravy.  Keep warm.

Go back to your tenderloin and slice.  Plate and serve with gravy.

Port Wine Ice Cream

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup half and half
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 6 large eggs
- 1 1/2 cups port
- 3 tablespoons grenadine
- :


METHOD:

Heat the heavy cream and half and half in a medium sauce pan over medium-high heat.  When hot, add 1/4 cup sugar and stir to dissolve.  Bring to a boil.

While the cream is heating, place the eggs and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in the bowl of an electrick mixer fitted with a paddle.  Beat the eggs on medium for 2-2 1/2 minutes.  Scrape down the bowl, then beat on medium until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, 2 1/2-3 minutes.  At this point, the cream should be boiling.  If not, adjust the mixer speed to low and continue to mix until the cream boils.  If this is not done, the eggs will develop undersirable lumps.

Pour the boiling cream into the beaten eggs, slowly, and whisk to combine.  REturn this mixture to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the cream reaches a temperature of 185F, 2-4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a stainless steel bowl.  Add the port and grenadine and whisk to combine thoroughly.  Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath for about 10-15 minutes.

Freeze in an ice-cream freezer following the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer the semifrozen ice cream to a plastic container, securely cover the container, then place in the freezer for several hours before serving.  Serve within 2 days.

Potato Herb Rolls

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 large russet potatoes, boiled, well mashed
- 2 cups warm water, or cooled potato water
- 1 cup sugar
- 3 tablespoons Saf-instant dry yeast*
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 9 cups ap flour
- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped,  (or other herb(s) of choice
- 6 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 cube unsalted butter, melted & cooled
- 3 teaspoons salt


METHOD:

Cool mashed potatoes to warm.

Place mashed potatoes, water, sugar and yeast in large mixing bowl and mix briefly with the paddle attachment to electric mixer.  Add 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of ap flour and mix until smooth (don't worry about lumps from potato).  Add an additional 1 cup flour and mix again.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled about 1 hour.  Remove the eggs from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature.  

Add the thyme to the above mixture and add the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition.  Mix in the butter & salt.  Add 5 cups of ap flour, mixing in with paddle attachment.  Change the paddle attachment to kneading hook for the mixer and add the last 2 cups of ap flour,  1/2 cup at a time, allowing the flour to completely integrate as you add the last of the flour.  (It may be necessary to add even more flour to the dough....add 1/4-1/2 cup at a time up to 1 cup more if necessary).  The final dough will be quite soft.  

Flour your work surface.  Pour the dough on the floured work surface and knead briefly to the right consistency.  Roll the dough out to 3/4" thick.  Cut the dough into 2" squares (smaller for hors d'oeuvre rolls) and place them on a buttered sheet pan, leaving room to expand between rolls.  Cover with a cloth, and allow to rise until about doubled, about
1 1/2 - 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 350F.  Bake rolls about 12 minutes.  Can be served warm or at room temperature.

*Saf-Instant yeast is NOT a rapid rise yeast.  It is called "instant" because it can be mixed in with the flour mixture without "proofing" it first in a little warm water.   It can be found in some super markets, bakery specialty stores and even some kitchen shops.  If you can't find this yeast, use a regular yeast and "proof" it before adding to the liquid portion by placing it in 1/2 cup of warm water (replacing some of the water in the recipe) and waiting for it to bubble, in about 10 minutes.  Add in with the liquid portion of the recipe.

Potato-Apple Bread

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 lb. floury potatoes, cooked, recipe below
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced
- 3 tablespoons unbleached flour, approximate (3-5 tablespoons)
- 2 medium apples, tart, peeled, cored and thinly sliced
- pat of butter
- griddle or heavy frying pan


METHOD:

The potatoes can either be baked or boiled in their skins until tender.  When cool enough to handle, peel off the skins, then put the hot flesh through a potato ricer or mash it...do not put into a food processor or you will have wallpaper paste.  

Stir in the salt, baking powder, and diced butter, then work in enough flour to make a firm dough...the exact amount will depend on the type of potato you use and how it was cooked.

Divide the dough into two equal pieces.  On a well-floured work surface, roll out each piece to a round about 7 inces in diameter.  Cover one round with the apple slices and add the pat of butter, then cover with the other round of dough.  Crimp or pinch the edges together to seal.

Heat the greased griddle or pan over medium heat.  Add the potato bread.  Turn the heat to low and cook gently until golden brown on the underside...about 5 minutes.  Using a large spatula, lift the bread onto a flat plate, then quickly invert it back onto the griddle so the bread can cook on the other side.  Cook for a further 4-5 minutes until browned.  Cut into wedges and eat immediately.

Potstickers

INGREDIENTS:

- 1/2 lb. ground pork
- 2 pinches baking soda
- 2 1/2 cups finely minced Napa cabbage
- 2 tablespoons minced ginger
- 2 tablespoons minced green onion
- 2 tablespoons minced cilantro
- 2 tablespoons Superior soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 3/4 teaspoon sesame seed oil
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 package round potsticker wrappers


METHOD:

1.  Combine filling.
2.  Place a small amount of filling in the center of the wonton wrapper; moisten all around the edges of the wonton wrapper with water and fold in half over filling, sealing shut.
3.  Heat the wok until hot (or a non-stick skillet can be used).  Heat 1 tablespoon of oil per batch.  When the oil is hot, place dumplings in the pan in a circular motion, about 8 at a time.  The dumpling should sizzle when placed into the hot oil.  Fill 3/4 way up the side of dumplings with water.  Cover and bring water to a boil on high heat.  Listen to the pan.  When the water has evaporated, the pan will start to sizzle, about 8 minutes.  Take off the lid.  Test for doneness by checking if the sealed part of the dumpling is cooked.  If not completely cooked, add more water and continue to steam.  When dumplings are cooked, open the lid and continue to brown the bottom of the dumplings until it is golden brown.

Alternative method:  The dumplings can be boiled in a large pot with water until done, then cooked on the griddle or non-stick pan to brown them on the bottom.  This method is good for mass production. The dumplings can also be frozen individually uncooked, then cook them as above without defrosting first.

Potted Plums with Phyllo Dough

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 lbs. red plums
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 9 tablespoons pistachio nuts, shelled and skinned
- 1 cup apricot preserves
- 3 tablespoons water
- 8 tablespoons sugar
- 12 sheets phyllo dough
- whipped cream


METHOD:

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Pit plums and cut each into four wedges   

Heat 1/2 of the butter in a saucepan.  When it is hot, saute the plums with the pistachios, preserves and water, covered, over high heat for 5 minutes until the plums are soft.  Remove the lid and cook 2-3 minutes longer to elinate any moisture remaining in the pan.  The mixture should be thick, not watery.  Add more sugar to the plums if needed for taste.

Melt the remaining butter.  Unwrap the phyllo sheets, lay them out and brush the top surface of the phyllo with butter and sprinkle with the remaining sugar between all the remaining sheets.  (Work one sheet at a time to prevent drying out).

Place 1/2-2/3 cups of the plum mixture in each of four small 1-cup ramekins.  Fold each sheet of phyllo in half, butter side out, and gather it gently into a loose tissue-like ball, taking care not to squeeze it.  Place one ball of the phyllo on top of each ramekin and arrange the ramekins on a tray.  Bake at 350F for 25-30 minutes.

Serve lukewarm with whipped sour cream or sweet cream.

Raspberry-Coconut Bars

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 12 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
- 2 large egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 cup coconut, chopped
- 2/3 cup raspberry jam
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice


METHOD:

Preheat the oven to 325F.  Make sure the rack is in the center of the oven.

Butter an oblong baking dish.

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  In a large mixing bowl beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute.  Gradually add the sugars and continue to beat until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes.  Beat in the egg yolks and vanilla.  With a spoon, stir in the dry ingredients.  Reserve 3 tablespoons of the coconut and stir in the remainder.

In a small bowl, stir together the jam and the lemon juice.

Press about half of the dough evenly in the bottom of the pan.  Spread with the flavored jam (apricot jam is good too).  Crumble the rest of the dough evenly over the top.  Because the dough is sticky this is a little hard but use floured hands and be presistent.  Sprinkle with the reserved 3 tablespoons of coconut..  Bake 50-60 minutes, until golden brown and firm.  Cool in the pan on a rack.  Cut lengthwise down the center and then crosswise into 10 even widths to make 20 bars.

Red Chile Brunch Enchiladas

INGREDIENTS:

- 8 medium dried ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 8 medium guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 6 cloves garlic
- salt to taste
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 8 red potatoes, small dice
- vegetable oil, or traditionally, lard
- 16 corn tortillas
- 8 large eggs
- 1 head curly endive, or other green lettuce of choice
- cider vinegar, to taste
- Mexican cheese


METHOD:

Tear the chiles to flat pieces.  Heat a cast iron skillet to hot and toast the chiles a few at a time, skin side down (this can be done on an outside grill) until aromatic. They may crackle a bit.  Usually about 10-12 seconds per side.

Place in a bowl and cover with about 6 cups of hot tap water.  Soak 20-30 minutes.

Using tongs, transfer the chiles to a food processor and add about 3 cups of the soaking liquid.  Add the garlic.  Puree.  Push through a medium strainer into a bowl.  The consistency should be sort of thick almost like canned tomato sauce.  Season hight with salt.  (this will taste a little rugged at this point).

Cook the potatoes in a salted water to cover until just tender.  Drain.

Heat some vegetable oil in a skillet and cook the onion about 5 minutes.  Add the potatoes and cook until brown and caramelized.  Heat the oven or grill to 325-350.

While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the tortillas.  Place the sauce and tortillas near the stove.  Dip the tortillas on both sides into the sauce.  Then lay the tortilla into the hot oil.  Let it cook for about 15 seconds, and then turn over, searing the other side for about 15 seconds.  Lay in a baking sheet with the rest of the seared tortillas in groups of two.  

Divide the potatoes among the tortillas and place in the oven or on the grill (with cover down) to warm for 5-10 minutes.  Fry the eggs in a separate skillet in oil.

While the eggs are cooking, toss the greens with the vinegar and a nice sprinkling of salt.  Put an enchilada-potato stack on each plate, top with a fried egg, the lettuce mixture and a sprinkling of the Mexican cheese.    Yum.....

Refrigerated Key Lime Pie

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

om the episode: Pucker-Up Pies

Be sure to use instant pudding that requires no stovetop cooking for this recipe. We use regular supermarket (Persian) limes-tasters thought bottled lime juice lacked depth of flavor. We much prefer our easy homemade crust to store- bought versions.

Serves 8 to 10.  

INGREDIENTS
Crust
8	whole graham crackers , broken into smaller pieces
2	tablespoons sugar
5	tablespoons unsalted butter , melted
Filling
1/4	cup sugar
1	tablespoon grated lime zest
8	ounces cream cheese , softened
1	 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/3	cup instant vanilla pudding mix
1 1/4	teaspoons unflavored gelatin
1	cup fresh lime juice from 6 to 8 limes
1	teaspoon vanilla extract
INSTRUCTIONS
1. For the crust: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Pulse crackers and sugar in food processor until finely ground.

Bake until fragrant and browned around edges, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool completely.

2. For the filling: Process sugar and zest in food processor until sugar turns bright green, about 30 seconds. Add cream cheese and process until combined, about 30 seconds. Add condensed milk and pudding mix and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl. Stir gelatin and 2 tablespoons lime juice in small bowl.

Roasted Cinnamon Ice Cream

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 teaspoons cinnamon, ground
- 2 cups half and half
- 1 large cinnamon stick, broken into 3-4 pieces
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 6 large egg yolks
- 2 cups heavy cream


METHOD:

In a small, non-stick skillet over low heat toast the ground cinnamon until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Shake the pan continuously over the fire to keep it from burning.  Remove, place on plat to cool and set aside.  Prepare a bowl with a strainer to have ready when the ice cream mixture is cooked.

In a 2 quart saucepan, heat the half and half with the broken pieces of cinnamon stick and sugar.  Heat until small bubbles appear around the edge.  Remove from heat and allow the cinnamon to infuse.  Meanwhile, separate the eggs, leaving just the yolks (save the whites for another use...they freeze nicely).  Beat  with a whisk until slightly thickened  in a bowl large enough to accomodate the existing warm cream mixture.  Whisk in the hot cream mixture, a little at a time (this is "tempering" the eggs so they will not curdle).  

Rinse out the pan but don't dry it....this keeps the mixture from sticking to the pan when you add it back into the pan.  After adding the custard mixture back into the pan, cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon and leaves a trail when you pass your finger through it.  Strain into your bowl awaiting.  Stir in the whipping cream (heavy cream).  Cool bowl within a larger bowl filled with ice and water.  Place plastic wrap on top of the mixture and place in the refrigerator for 6-8 hours or overnight before freezing in an ice cream maker (according to manufacturer's directions).

Royal Chicken Cooked in Yogurt

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup yogurt, skim milk
- 1 teaspoon salt
- freshly ground pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1/4 cup cilantro, finely chopped
- 6 chicken breast half without skin
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 8 cardamom pods
- 6 whole cloves
- 2 inch cinnamon stick
- 3 bay leaf
- 2 1/2 tablespoons blanched almond, slivered
- 2 1/2 tablespoons raisins, golden


METHOD:

Put yogurt into a bowl.  Beat it lightly until it is smooth and creamy.  Add 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, some black pepper, the ground cummin, ground coriander, cayenne and cilantro.  Mix and set aside.

Using the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, season the chicken pieces on both sides and sprinkle on some freshly ground black pepper.

Put the oil in a wide, preferable nonstick pan and set over medium-high heat.  When the oil is hot, put in the cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon and bay leaves.  Stir once and put in some of the chicken pieces in a single layer.  Brown on both sides and remove to a large bowl.  Brown all the chicken pieces this way and transfer them to the bowl.  Put the almonds and raisins into the same hot oil.  Stir quickly.  The almonds should turn golden and the raisins should plump up.

Now put the chicken and its accumulated juices back into the pan.  Add the seasoned yogurt.  Stir to mix and bring to a simmer.  Cover, turn the heat to low and simmer gently for 20 minutes, stirring once or twice during this time.  Remove the cover, turn the heat up a bit and reduce the sauce until it is thick and just clings to the chicken pieces.  Turn the chicken pieces over gently as you do this.

*The large whole spices.....cardamom pods, whole cloves cinnamon stick and bay leaves are not to be eaten.

Royal Roast Leg of Lamb with Saffron Raisin Sauce (Shahi Raan)

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 7 1/2 - 9 pound leg of lamb, boned and butterflied, tied & reformed to roast
- Marinade
- 1 tablespoon garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoons ginger root, chopped
- 1 teaspoon black cumin seeds, roasted
- 1 teaspoon red pepper, or to taste
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Mughal garam masala
- 4 teaspoons Kosher salt
- 3/4 cup golden raisins
- 1/2 cup raw pistachios, or walnuts
- 4 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 3/4 cup plain yogurt
- 1/4 cup sour cream


METHOD:

2          teaspoons  saffron threads
  2        tablespoons  flour -- dissolved in 3 tablespoons water

Prick the top of the lamb with a skewer and place in a Dutch oven.

Put all the ingredients of the marinade in a food processor, running the processor until the mixture is of a thick paste consistency (add a little water if necessary).

Pour over the lamb and coat thoroughly.  Allow to marinate in the frig for 3 days.. ( If you start late in this process, leave the lamb butterflied and you can marinate for half the time.  Roll back into a roast after marinating.) Take out of the refrigerator about 1 hour before cooking, allowing it to come to room temperature.  Preheat the oven to 350F.

Over a small bowl, crush the saffron threads, making as fine a powder as possible.  Add 2 tablespoons of hot water and soak the saffron for 15 minutes.  Sprinkle this mixture over the lamb.

Place the Dutch oven with the lamb in it on a burner over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Pour 1 cup of boiling water down the sides of the pan.  Cover the pan with a piece of aluminum foil and top that with a lid.  

Roast the lamb in the 350F oven for 1 1/2 hours.  Lower the heat to 225F and continue roasting for an additional 45 minutes.  Turn off the oven and leave the lamb in the oven with the door shut for an additional 45 minutes.  The dish is now done.  It will stay hot in the oven for up to 45 minutes longer.

Take the lamb out of the oven and move to a cutting board.  Remove the trussing string.  Heat the contents of the pan to a simmer, skimming off the fat.  Add the water mixture and cook stirring, until thickened (about 2 minutes).  Taste for salt.

Slice the meat and place on a warm platter.  Spoon sauce over the meat.  Serve with rice and vegetable.

Rum Cake

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup pecans, chopped
- 1 18 1/2 oz yellow cake mix
- 1 3 3/4 oz Jello Vanilla Instand Pudding & Pie Fill
- 4 eggs
- 1/2 cup dark rum
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1/2 cup water
- Glaze:
- 1 cube butter
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup dark rum
- 1/2 cup water


METHOD:

Preheat oven to 325 F.  Grease and flour a 10" tube or 12 C bundt pan.  Sprinkle nuts over bottom (of pan..not yours).  Mix all cake ingredients together.  Pour batter over nuts (no, not in the room, in the pan).  Bake 1 hour.  Cool.  Invert on plate.  Prick top and drizzle and smooth hot glaze evenly over top and sides.  Allow cake to absorb and repeat until glaze is used up.

Glaze:  Melt butter and stir in water and sugar.  Boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and stir in rum.

NOTES:

NOTES : Yes, this is a "cake mix" recipe...my Mom calls me a "cake mix snob"...but it really works and deliciously!  Use this recipe without the glaze or the nuts on the bottom of the pan  for the Italian Christmas Cake.  Or, serve it with the glaze with a "dollop" (thats what they say in real cookbooks) of homemade whipped cream.  Mmmmmm.

Salmon w/ Roasted Lemon Beurre Blanc

INGREDIENTS:

- 8 1" salmon fillet
- olive oil
- salt and pepper
- Lemon Beurre Blanc:
- 1 small lemons, poked and roasted in microwave
- 1/4 cup white wine vinegar
- 1/3 cup white wine (fume or sauvignon blanc)
- 2 medium shallots, minced
- 1 tablespoon heavy cream
- 1 cup cold butter, cut into small cubes and
- held on ice with paper barrier


METHOD:

1.  Make the beurre blanc first; allow your timing so that it holds no longer than
15 minutes over hot water bath.
2. Place fork-poked lemons in microwave oven for approximately 45-60 seconds.
3.  Squeeze lemon juice from both lemons into stainless steel pot that you plan to make
beurre blanc in.  Add vinegar, wine, shallots and s/p  and reduce the entire mixture  to
about 1/4 cup.
4.  Add about 1 tablespoon of cream to stabilize mixture (classically, this is not done; however, it's a trick that everyone uses  as the beurre blanc is an emulsification,  very fragile and can "break" easily).
5.  Take cut up butter, leaving it on the paper on the ice while you work, and whisk it into the reduction one small piece at a time.  The pot should remain on very low heat.  Continue to do this until all the butter is mixed in.**
6.  Taste the mixture and adjust seasoning as preferred by your taste with s/p.
Sometimes it needs nothing at this point.
7.  Strain into a small stainless steel bowl or stainless pot and hold over a pan of hot water over very low heat.
**  If the sauce "breaks" (you would see the butter separate from the rest of the ingredients and float to the top); you can repair it by starting over with your reduction mixture, even in smaller quantities, and slowly add back in the broken sauce and continue with the process.  You may want to add more  cold butter to overcome the additional stronger taste from the added new reduction.  A word of encouragement:  this probably won't happen with the bit of cream added at the beginning.

To saute the fillets:

1.  Place a small amount of olive oil and butter into saute pan.  Place the fillets in the pan.  Add s/p  and saute until about 1/3 of the fish has turned opaque as you view it from the side.  
2.  Turn the fish over and continue to cook until just a thin line of pink remains through the middle of the salmon.  The entire process takes about 7-10 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.
3.  Place a small amount of the beurre blanc on a warm plate and top with one each of the fish fillets.  Place a bit more of  the sauce on top and top that with a small amount of lemon zest.  Add a touch of green:  Italian parsley stem, green vegetable, ie., braised fennel or leek, etc.  Use your imagination and make it pretty!!

NOTES:

NOTES : The whole idea of this recipe is the two techniques of sauteing, used with the fish fillets and the making of the classic French Beurre Blanc.  Be reassured that you can use any fish fillet or even sauted shrimp or a combination for this dish....as usual, use your imagination and make it wonderful.  This can be a first course, served alone with a garnish, or a main course served with baby red potatoes, a vegetable and beautifully presented.  Beurre blanc is a wonderful sauce for vegetables as well.  Adding the lemon makes it perfect for fish.

Samsa ....A Tapenade

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

SAMSA

The contemporary version of this spread, tapenade, is a classic hors d’oeuvre in Provence, served on slices of bread.

It is also a versatile sauce that can be tossed with mushrooms and oil in a frying pan, spread on a roasted chicken, blended into a salad dressing or spread onto a turkey sandwich.

It is a good idea to desalt the olives, even though it takes time and effort. It is worthwhile, as the flavour is significantly improved and the paste is less bitter and salty.

INGREDIENTS 

1 kg (2 pounds) black olives, choose the shrivelled Greekstyle olives, in their own oil 
1 garlic clove, minced 
Half a lemon 
4 tablespoons olive oil 
4 anchovy filets (the anchovies should be cured in salt) 
1 tablespoon cumin seeds 
1 tablespoon aniseed

First de-seed your olives - you can get a handy gadget to do this quicker. Now de-salt them by transferring them into a basin of water and rinse, changing the water six or seven times, using a fine sieve to retain the olive flesh. Leave them to soak while you continue with the recipe.

To prepare the anchovies, pour three tablespoons of olive oil into a very small frying pan, add the anchovy fillets and stir with a fork, lightly mashing the fillets to dissolve them into the oil. Let them bubble lightly for just a moment. Remove from the heat and add the pureed garlic. Return to the heat and stir while letting it cook for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat. Pour the olives, well strained, into a blender, with a tablespoon of the anchovy puree, the remaining olive oil, and the cumin and aniseed.

San Francisco Style Poached Eggs

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Active Time:  25 Minutes
Total Time:  25 Minutes
Yield:  Serves 4
In this rendition of Eggs Benedict, poached eggs top fresh asparagus and a pancetta waffle. However, tradition isn't totally abandoned. Lemon hollandaise smothers it all. Look for Meyer lemons to enhance the sauce further.
RECIPE INGREDIENTS
For the Waffles:
4 slices pancetta or bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup heavy cream
2 eggs at room temperature
For the Sauce:
3 egg yolks at room temperature
Salt and ground white pepper to taste
1-1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest, preferably Meyer lemon
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, preferably Meyer lemon
1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives
For the Asparagus:
12 asparagus stalks, trimmed
For the Eggs:
1 tablespoon Chardonnay or white wine vinegar
8 eggs

DIRECTIONS
FOR THE WAFFLES:
In a small skillet, cook the pancetta or bacon over medium high heat until lightly browned. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Preheat a waffle iron. In a blender or food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Pulse quickly to blend. Add the pancetta or bacon, cream, and eggs and process for 6 seconds. Scrape the sides of the container. Pulse for 3 seconds to fully mix.

Pour 1/2 cup of the batter onto the hot waffle iron and cook for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Keep warm in a low oven. Repeat to cook the remaining batter. (To make ahead, let the waffles cool, then wrap in plastic wrap, place in a freezer bag, and freeze. To thaw, place in the toaster or 350 degree F oven and cook until heated through.)

FOR THE SAUCE:
In a blender or food processor, combine the egg yolks, salt, and pepper and process for 10 seconds. In a small saucepan, melt the butter until it foams. With the machine running, pour the melted butter in a thin stream into the blender or processor. Add the zest and lemon juice and pulse to incorporate. Pour the sauce into a bowl and place over a pan filled with 2 inches of hot water to keep the sauce warm. Stir in the chives just before serving. (You can also keep the hollandaise warm in a Thermos.)

FOR THE ASPARAGUS:
Cook the asparagus in a skillet of salted boiling water for 3 minutes, or until easily pierced with a knife. Drain and reserve.

FOR THE EGGS:
Bring a large skillet of water to a boil. Add the vinegar and reduce heat to a simmer. Break the eggs, one at a time, into a saucer and slide them into the water. With a spoon, gently bring the egg white over the center of each yolk to keep the whites intact. Cook for 4 minutes for soft-centered yolks. With a slotted spoon, transfter the eggs to a clean dish towel. (To make the eggs ahead of time: Cook the eggs for 3 minutes. Place them in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Before serving, cook the poached eggs in simmering water for 1 minute to reheat.)

TO SERVE:
Place a hot waffle on each of 4 warm plates and top with 3 asparagus stalks, 1 poached egg, and some hollandaise.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, or until smooth.  The dough will be soft.  Cut the dough into 4 pieces, wrap each piece in plastic wrap, and chill for 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375F.  Lightly grease two cookie sheets.  Grind the figs, diates and raisins in a food processor until coarse.  Place the mixture in a bowl and add the reamining filling ingredients and mix well.  The mixture will be thick.  Set aside.

On a floured surface, roll out one piece of dought at a time into a 12" square.  Cut the dough into 4x3" retangles.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of the filling mixture down the center of each rectangle.  Carefully fold the long edges of each rectangle over to meet in the center, then pinch the seam to close securely.  Turn the cookies seam side down and seal the short ends by  folding the dough under.  Shape the cookies into crescents and place on the cookie sheets.

Make 2-3 diagonal slits in the top of each crescent with scissors.  Brush with the egg wash.  Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on racks.

Simple French Loaf

INGREDIENTS:

- 6 cups all purpose unbleached flour*, or 3 cups bread flour & 3 cups AP flour
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 2 1/2 cups water, slightly warm


METHOD:

Place 3 cups of flour in heavy duty mixer  mixing bowl.  Add yeast and turn on mixer  with paddle mixer to mix.  Add water while mixer is mixing.  Mix for about 5 minutes to begin to develop gluten.  Add salt.  Mix about 30 seconds.  Add another 1/2 cup of flour and mix in.   Change to dough hook.  Add the rest of flour* 1/2 cup at a time, mixing thoroughly, until dough comes together and the internal temperature is at approximately 78-80F.  

Take out of bowl (if it is slightly wet, this is okay) and place into lightly sprayed bowl to raise.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to double in size in bowl (about 2 hours).

Punch down dough and turn over.  Cover again and allow to rise until double, about 1 hour.  

Take out of bowl and shape as desired.  Place on corn meal sprinkled sheet pan.  Cover with towel and allow to rise about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile heat oven to 450F.  When loaves are doubled in size, slash; spray with water and place in oven (or on stone).  Spray the oven and then spray the oven twice again within the first 3-5 minutes.  Continue to bake the loaves for about 20 minutes.  Check the loaves for being done by thumping them...they should sound hollow.  The internal temperature for this loaf is at about 210F.  The will  be dark for a crunchy crust.

*  If you wish, you can replace some of AP flour with whole wheat flour and/or rye flour and or semolina flour.  It is fun to experiment with all kinds of good things:  oatmeal, soy flour, bean flour, etc.  Just add ingredients and subtract AP flour until you reach the right texture.

**Also you can save a piece of dough (about 20% of the dough) and use it in part of the next dough; adding it in the beginning 5 minutes of "wet" mixture.  This increases the flavor of your dough.

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

The Smith Family's 12-Layer Cake
Created by Art Smith

 
This recipe, handed down from Art's great-great-grandmother, has taken center stage at many Smith family celebrations. Make it part of your next special occasion!

Ingredients:Makes 16–20 servings

4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour , sifted
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter , at room temperature
2 1/2 cups sugar
6 large eggs , at room temperature
3 cups milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder , preferably Dutch process
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter , cut up
1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
Pecan halves, for garnish
Position racks in the center and bottom third of the oven and preheat to 375°. Lightly butter four 8 1/2- to 9-inch cake pans (you will bake the cakes in three batches) and line the bottoms with rounds of parchment paper. Flour the pans and tap out the excess.

To make the layers, sift together the sifted flour, baking powder and salt. Sift the mixture one more time, and set aside.

Beat the butter and sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with the paddle blade on high speed until light in color and texture, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Scrape down the bowl and be sure the mixture is well-blended. On low speed, add the flour in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions of the milk, beginning and ending with the flour, and beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl often with a rubber spatula. Beat in the vanilla. Using a scant cup for each layer, spread the batter evenly in the pans. It will make a thin layer.

Staggering the pans on the racks so they are at least 2 inches from each other and the sides of the oven and not directly over each other, bake the layers until they feel firm when pressed in the centers and are beginning to pull away from the sides of the pans, about 12 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Invert the layers onto cake racks, remove the parchment paper, and cool completely. Wash and prepare the pans. Repeat the procedure until all 12 layers have been baked and cooled.

To make the icing, bring the sugar, cocoa, butter and evaporated milk to a full boil in a large saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the icing has thickened slightly (it will resemble chocolate syrup but will thicken as it cools), about 3 minutes. Stir in the vanilla. Let the icing cool until thick enough to spread, but still pourable.

Place a layer of cake on a wire rack set over a jelly-roll pan. Spread with a few tablespoons of the icing, letting the excess run down the sides. Stack the remaining cakes, icing each layer. Pour the remaining icing over the top of the cake. If you wish, smooth the icing on the edges to cover the sides. Place pecan halves around the top perimeter of the cake. Let stand until the glaze sets. (The cake is best served the day it is made. To store, cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 1 day.)

Recommended technique: If you buy inexpensive aluminum foil cake pans at the grocery store (they can be saved for another time as well), you will be able to knock out layers in no time. And no washing between baking!

Sopa de Ajo

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup olive oil
- 2 large head of garlic, cloves peeled, chopped into rough 1/8" pieces
- 10 cups chicken stock, homemade
- 8 slices good bread, crusts removed
- 2 ripe avocado, peeled, pitted and cut into 1/2" dice
- 6 ounces Mexican queso fresco, cut into 1/2" cubes
- 2 large ripe tomatoes, cut into small dice
- 8 green onions, lightly brushed with o/o, grilled, chopped
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 8 canned chiptles en adobo, seeded and thinly sliced


METHOD:

Heat the o/o in a small heavy pot over medium low.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until very soft and golden, 15-20 minutes, simmering the whole time.  The garlic should be soft, almost gooey, not browned and crisp at the end.

Set a strainer over a small bowl and pour in the oil and garlic.  Transfer the garlic into a medium size soup pot and stir in the stock.  Partially cover and simmer over medium heat 30 minutes.  (Set the garlic oil aside; you'll need more for this recipe but save the rest for viniagrettes and other cooking...store in the frig).

Turn on the oven to 325F.  While the soup is simmering, cut the bread into 1/2 inch cubes and toast on a baking sheet in the oven until thoroughly dry but not brown, about 20 minutes.  Drizzle with about 6 tablespoons of the garlic oil, toss to thoroughly coat and return to the oven for 5 minutes more, until the croutons are nicely golden.

When the soup is ready, taste and season with salt.  Divide the avocado, fresh cheese and optional tomato and green onions among warm soup bowls.  A coupel of minutes before serving, remove the soup from the heat, let stand 30 seconds to cool a bit, stir in the eggs with a spoon (they give the stock body and creaminess), then ladle into the bowls.  Top each portion with croutons and a few strips of chipotle and carrry directly to the table.

Soup Foundation

INGREDIENTS:

- onion or leek
- carrot
- celery
- olive oil
- fresh herbs, rosemary, thyme, sage, oregano
- garlic
- red chile flakes
- sausage, meat or main vegetable of choice
- stock, chicken, beef or vegetable


METHOD:

This is the foundation for making any soup you wish.  This is a terrific and healthy way to use up bits and pieces or leftovers to change one meal into an entirely different and wonderful meal.

Depending on the quantity desired,  chop one or two onions, 2-3 carrots, and 2-3 celery or approximately.  This really doesn't matter, just use what you have and some judgement depending on the amount you want to make.  Heat about 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil in a soup pot and add the vegetables.  Cook until translucent, about 7-8 minutes over medium heat.  Add whatever fresh herbs you like, or have on hand (even dry will do in a pinch).  You can be generous with fresh herbs,  giving your finished dish a wonderful fresh flavor. Cook briefly until fragrant.   Add minced garlic to taste.  Cook briefly, being careful not to burn the garlic.  If you want a little heat, add a few red chile flakes....or not.

If you want to add meat, use leftover roast chicken, beef or pork.  Or use any kind of fresh or smoked sausage.  Add to the pan and cook a bit to heat through.    

If you prefer to make a "pureed" vegetable soup, add the vegetable instead of the meat at this point in large quantity....i.e., 2-3 pounds of broccoli; cauliflower; squash; whatever you desire.  The above seasonings can be changed in any fashion you want to go nicely with your vegetable.

Add enough stock to cover.  

If you are making a "meat-style" soup, you may want to also add at this time some additional vegetables to fill out your soup; i.e. zucchini, tomatoes, spinach or any bits and pieces of things you may have.  Cook for about 20 minutes or so (until you are ready for it!).

If you are making a "pureed" vegetable soup, cook the vegetables in the stock until soft.  Puree and season to taste.  Sometimes, adding a little cream is a nice touch.

Sourdough Starter

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 potatoes, with skins on
- enough water to completely cover
- 1 tablespoon sugar


METHOD:

Cook the potatoes in the water until completely overdone.  Mash this all together (with the skins) and strain through a spaghetti strainer, where the skins will lift out of the strainer.  You will end up with a thick potato soup texture.

Slightly cool.  Add about 2 cups of a good flour (like King Arthur) and stir well.  Don't worry about the lumps as they will dissolve.  Add one tablespoon of sugar.

The starter is completed.  Stir it daily and add a little more flour and a pinch of sugar each day as you will notice it starting to bubble (keep in a warm place).

When you see an inch or more of bubbles on the top it is ready to use.  Save 1 cup or more of the starter.  To this add warm water and flour like you did the first time.  Your starter is alive and active.  It can be used for may years this way.

Spelt Flour Focaccia

INGREDIENTS:

- Starter:
- 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1/4 cup warm water, 105-115F
- 1 1/2 cups water, room temperature
- 3 1/4 cups white spelt flour
- Dough:
- 2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast, (1 package)
- 1/2 cup warm water, 105-115F
- 3/4 cup +2 tablespoons spelt flour starter, above, at least 12 hours old
- 2 1/2 cups water, room temperature
- 6 3/4 cups +2 tablespoons white spelt flour
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- For the pans & topping:
- 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large full-flavored ripe tomato, peeled and
- diced
- 3/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt
- few oregano sprigs, or 3/4 teaspoon dried oregano


METHOD:

Prepare the spelt flour starter by sprinkling the yeast over the warm water in a large mixing bowl.  Whisk it in and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.  With paddle attachment of a heavy-duty mixer (or by hand) mix in the room-temperature water and then the flour mixing for about 1-2 minutes.

Rising:  Transfer the starter to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rise at a cool room trmperature for 6-24 hours.  The starter will triple in volume and then collapse upon itself.  It will still be set and sticky when ready to use.  Cover and set aside at room termperature for at least 12 hours.  Refrigerate after 24 hours.  

When you are ready to make the dough, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a large mixing bowl; whisk it in and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.  Chop up the starter or squeeze it through your fingers and add it with the 2 1/2 cups room-temp. water to the yeast mixture; mix with the paddle of the mixer until blended.  Add the flour and salt to the yeast mixture and continue to mix with the paddle attachment until a dough is formed, 3-4 minutes.  The dough will pull away from the sides of the mixer bowl but not the bottom.  

Change to the dough hook and knead at medium speed for 2-3 minutes or until the dough is elastic, sticky and soft but not wet.  You will see many bubbles under the skin.

First rise:  Place the dough in a lightly oiled container, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Shaping and second rise:  Prepare two rectangle or round baking pans bys pouring 2 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil into each and tilting to cover bottom and sides well.  Turn the sticky, elastic dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, divide it in half and sprinkle the tops wvery lightly with just enough four to counteract the stickiness.  Place each piece in a prepared baking pan and stretch the dough outward to cover as much of the bottom as possible.  It will reside, so cover it with a towel and leave it to relax for 10 minutes.  Stretch the dough more, cover, and let riseuntil well puffed, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Topping.  Dimple the tops vigorously with your index fingers and brush with oil, using the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil.  Sprinkle the dought with the tomato, coarse salt and a little oregano and finish by drizzling a little more oil to collect in pools on top of the dough.

Baking:  Preheat the oven to 425F (at least 30 minutes before baking).  Place the foccacias in the oven (on a preheated stone if you have one).  Spritz the oven with water and bake the foccacias for 20-25 minutes until golden.

Spinach Feta Filo Triangles

INGREDIENTS:

- Filling:
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, shredded
- 1 medium leek, white part only
- 2 packages frozen chopped spinach, 10 oz each
- drained and squeezed between palms to of
- hands to remove moisture
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- 2 large eggs
- 3/4 cup feta cheese, crumbled
- 1/2 pint cottage cheese, small curd
- 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 tablespoon dry bread crumbs
- 1 package filo dough, thawed according to pkg. directions
- 2 cups clarified butter, melted


METHOD:

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet.  When it is hot add the onion and leek and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until lightly browned.  Stir in the spinach and the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil.  Continue to cook, stirring, until the mixture stops steaming.  Stir in the dill, salt and pepper until well blended.  Turn the mixture into a large bowl and refrigerate until cooled.  When ready to proceed, stir in the eggs, cheeses and bread crumbs until very well blended.

Lay the stack of filo with the longest side facing you on a large, flat work surface.  Cut the stack into 6 equal strips, cutting lengthwise.  ( ruler helps...cut about 5 1/2" wide x 3 and then cut those strips in half again).

Proceed to fill.  Butter each strip with a pastry brush (keep the others covered).  Quickly, place a rounded teaspoon of filling at the bottom of the strip.  Then fold as you would for a flag, a continuous move of right angles, each time making a triangle, folding until you reach the end of the strip.  Place on an ungreased baking sheet.  Continue on the rest of the strips until all the cheese filling is used.  You will have about 48 pieces, more or less.

Bake in the top of the oven for 10 minutes. Brush with butter again and continue to bake for 10 more minutes or until golden.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately or cool on wire rack and reheat later.

Steamed Chocolate Pudding

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 1/3 cups sugar + 3 tablespoons
- 2 1/2 cups blanced almonds, coarsely chopped
- 1/2 lb. semisweet chocolate, cut into small chunks
- 3 tablespoons strong coffee
- 1/2 lb. unsalted butter, softened
- 10 large egg yolks
- 10 large egg whites
- 2 cups heavy cream, chilled
- 3 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla


METHOD:

With a pastry brush and 2 tablespoons of softened butter, coat the bottom and sides of a 2 quart steamed pudding mold, that is a mold with a snugly fitting cover.  Pour in 3 tablespoons of sugar and tip the mold over and knock out the excess sugar.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Spread the almonds out evenly in a shallow roasting pan.  Toast them in the middle of the oven for about 10 minutes, stirring them occasionally until they are light brown.  Be careful not to let them burn.  Set them aside.

Melt the chocolate with the coffee, stirring constantly, in a bowl over a double boiler over simmering water.  Cool to lukewarm.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the 1/2 pound of butter and 1 1/3 cups of sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy.  Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, then little by little add the melted chocolate and coffee and continue to beat until the batter is smooth.  Stir in the almonds.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks on the beater when it is lifted out of the bowl.  Stir about one quarter of the whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then ppour it over the remaining egg whites and gently but thoroughly fold them together.  Spoon the pudding into the prepared mold, smooth the top with a spatula and cover the mold tightly.

Place the mold in a large pot and add enough water to come two thirds of the way up the side of the mold.  Bring the water to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to its lowest point, cover the pot and simmer undisturbed for 1 hour.  Then remove the mold from the water and wipe it dry.  Remove the cover and unmold the pudding in the following fashion:  Run a long, sharp knife around the inside edges of the mold, then place a heated serving plate over the mold.  Grasping mold and plate together turn them over.  Rap the plate on a table and the pudding should slide out easily.

Whip the chilled cream until slightly thickened.  Sprinkle in the powdered sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff.  Serve the pudding while it is still hot, accompanied by the whipped cream.

Steamed Egg Custard

INGREDIENTS:

- 8 medium dried black mushrooms
- 1 ounce bean threads, glass noodles
- 2 tablespoons Chinese chives, or fresh green peas
- 1/2 cup smoked ham, or honey cured, slivered
- Custard Mixture:
- 4 large eggs, room temperature
- 2 1/4 cups chicken stock, room temperature
- 2 teaspoons chicken fat, liquid state (optional)
- 1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine
- 1 tablespoon thin soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- Garnish:
- 1 teaspoon thin soy sauce
- green onions, sliced


METHOD:

Soak the dried mushrooms in hot water to cover until soft and spongy for about 20 minutes.  Snip off the stems and rinse the caps to dislodge sand.  Cut into slivers 1/8".

Soak the bean threads in hot water until rubber-band firm, not mushy.  Drain, rinse and drain again.  Cut into 2" lengths, then gently simmer the drained noodles and slivered mushrooms in 1 cup of the chicken stock until the noodles are silky soft and transparent, about 2 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and let the noodles and mushrooms cool in the stock.

Beat the eggs lightly, until thoroughly mixed but not frothy.  Skim off and discard any froth.  Combine the remaining 1 1/4 cup stock, chicken fat, wine and soy, stirring lightly to blend, then add to the eggs in a thin stream, stirring lightly to combine.  Bit by bit, add the stock used to poach the noodles, stirring gently, then gradually add the salt.

Take care not to beat the mixture or you will create bubbles that will undermine the final texture of the custard.  Once blended, strain the egg mixture thrugh a fine sieve to trap all the googly egg bits.

Scatter the mushrooms, noodles, peas or garlic chives and pork in the bottom of a deep, heatproof 1 1/2 quart bowl.  Pour the egg mixture to within 1/2" of the lip.  Cover the bowl with aluminum foil to prevent condensation during steaming.  Proceed to steam the custard.

Bring the water in a steaming vessel to a gushing boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium to maintain a gentle steam.  Add the covered bowl to the steamer.  Cover the steamer and steam the custard undisturbed for 25-30 minutes.  It is done when a knife inserted about an inch down into the center of the custard comes out clean.  The texture will be very tender, not firm.

Remove the bowl carefully and life the foil straight up to avoid adding any water that may have accumulated to the custard.  Garnish with a sprinkling of soy followed by the green onion rings.

Steamed Pork Dumplings

INGREDIENTS:

- 14 ounces small Asian style tapioca pearls
- 2 cups boiling water
- 1/2 lb. boneless lean pork, fresh ham or trimmed butt
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon minced coriander roots, or stems
- 1/4 cup salted radish, rinsed, drained, finely chopped
- 3/4 cup dry roasted peanuts, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1/2 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper
- banana or cabbage leaves to line steamers
- Garnish
- 1 head Bibb or green leaf lettuce, washed, dried and sep into leaves
- 1 tablespoon garlic oil, Cook 3 tablespoons minced garlic in 1/4 cup oil
- 3 tablespoons fried garlic or fried shallots
- 1/4 cup coriander or mint leaves
- 2 tablespoons Thai or serrano chilles


METHOD:

Place the tapioca in a medium bowl and gradually add the water, stirring.  Knead to a smooth paste, then cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 1-1 1/2 hours.

Thinly slice the pork into strips and then cut crosswise into very small cubes; set aside.

Heat the oil in a wok and toss in the garlic and coriander roots.  Stir fry until the garlic starts to turn golden, then toss in the pork.  Stir fry until the pork has changed color.  Add the radish, peanuts, fish sauce, sugar and pepper and stir fry briefly until the sugar has melted and the ingredients are  blended.  Set aside to cool.

When the tapioca is ready; line the steamer racks with banana or cabbage leaves and oil the leaves slightly.  Cut the tapioca dough in half.  Work with one half at a time, leaving the remaining dough covered with plastic wrap.

On a lightly oiled work surface, roll the dough back and forth under your palms into a smooth cylinder about 12" long and 1 1/2" in diameter.  Slice crosswise in half, then cut each half into 8 slices.

With lightly oiled hands, on the lightly oil surface, flatten a slice of dough to a disk about 1 1/2 " in diameter.  Lay it on the palm of one hand and place a slightly heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center.  Wrap the dough over the filling, thenpinch the ends and roll in your palm to shape a ball.  If the dough cracks, don't worry, it's easy to patch and will be fine.  The first few shaping attempts may feel awkward because the dough is not very pliable, but the work goes quickly, as as the dough cooks, it will seal any holes.

Place the ball on a steamer rack.  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling, making sure the balls are not touching each other on the rack.

Once one steamer rack is full, place it over water in a pot or wok and bring to a boil.  Cover and steam for 10-15 minutes until the dough is translucent and tender.  Remove from the steamer and set aside while you assemble and cook the remaining dumplings.  (At this point, they can be left at room temperature for up to 2 hours.)

To serve:  Arrange the balls on a serving plate lined with lettuce leaves and sprinkle on a little garlic oil, then top with the fried garlic or fried shallots.  On another plate, arrange a pile of the remaining leaf lettuce, the coriander or mint leaves and the chopped chiles.

To eat, wrap a dumpling, some coriander or mint and a little chile in a lettuce leaf.  Each dumpling makes two or three very flavorful mouthfuls.

Streusel Cinnamon Coffee Cake

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

An ideal companion for your morning beverage, this cake takes its name from the German word that describes its casually "strewn" topping. Baking powder, used instead of yeast, makes it possible to prepare the coffee cake shortly before serving.
RECIPE INGREDIENTS
For the Streusel:
1/2 cup firmly packed light or dark brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
1/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled
For the Cake:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
3 eggs
1 1/4 cups buttermilk mixed with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 firm but ripe pears, such as Bosc, Anjou or Comice, peeled, cored, coarsely chopped

DIRECTIONS
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Set aside.

FOR THE STREUSEL:
In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, flour, walnuts and butter. Using 2 knives, your fingertips or a pastry blender, work the ingredients together until the mixture resembles large bread crumbs. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

FOR THE CAKE:
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer set on high speed, beat the butter until light and fluffy. Gradually add the brown and granulated sugars, continuing to beat until very light, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

Reduce the mixer to low speed and gradually beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, beating until just mixed.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Scatter the chopped pears and the streusel mixture evenly over the top, then press them gently into the top of the batter.

Bake until the top of the cake is firm, the streusel is crisp and bubbling and a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 40-45 minutes.

TO SERVE:
Transfer to a wire rack and let cool slightly in the pan. Cut into squares and serve warm.

Sushi Rice

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 cups Japanese style short grain rice, washed repeatedly until water is clear
- 1 2" square kombu (kelp)
- 2 tablespoons sake (rice wine)
- Vinegar Dressing:
- 6 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 2/3 teaspoons salt


METHOD:

After washing rice, allow to sit in colander for an hour before cooking.

Cook the rice with the kombu and sake in a rice cooker.

When you start to cook the rice, begin to make the dressing.  Combine 6 tablespoons of the rice vinegar, the sugar and salt in a bowl and stir.    This advance planning will give the sugar and salt time to dissolve before the rice is cooked.

When the rice is cooked, allow it to remain in the rice pot another 5 minutes, covered.   Rub the inside of a large bowl and spatula with the remaining vinegar.  Transfer the cooked rice all at once and quickly pour the vinegar dressing evenly over the rice in the bowl.  Cut the rice vertically with the spatula and lift the rice and turn it over.  Don't mash the rice.  This should be completed rapidly, in less than 2 minutes.

At the end of the tossing, lay the rice on a parchment-lined pan and fan with a hand fan.  This will help it cool and gelatinize the surface of the rice, making it look pretty.

Do not refrigerate.  Cover with a damp towel until ready to use later in the day.SOURCE: Adapted from Hiroko Shimbo

While the cake is baking, prepare the topping by shisking together the sour cream, sugar and apple cider.  When the cake is done baking, remove it from the oven to cool for 5 minutes and turn the oven to 350F.  Spread the sour cream topping over the baked cheesecake using a small offset spatula to ensure an even layer.  Bake at 350 degrees for 5 minutes until the topping is just set.  Remove from the oven.  Gently run a paring knife around the top outer edge of the pan and allow the cake to cool completely.

Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it for several hours or up to two days before serving.

Sweet Tart Dough....also called Pate Sucree

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup + 1 tablespoon powdered sugar
- 1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
- pinch of salt
- 9 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1 large egg


METHOD:

Sift together the flour, sugar and salt into a bowl.

Place the butter in a food processor and process until smooth, about 15 seconds.  Scatter the flour mixture over the butter, add the egg and process just until the dough forms a mass; do not overmix.  Turn the dough out onto the counter and divide it in two.  Shape each half into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for a least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.  Half of the dough may be well wrapped and frozen for up to 1 month.

Let the dough stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to soften.  Lightly butter two 9" fluted tart pans with removable bottoms.

Dust a work surface lightly with flour.  Dust one of the discs lightly with flour and using a floured rolling pin, roll it out into a rough 12" circle.  Lift the dough often, making sure that wthe work surface and dough are lightly floured at all times.  Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin and gently unroll it over one of the prepared tart pans.  Press the dough into the pan and roll the pin over the top of the pan to remove the excess dough.  Repeat with the remaining dough and tart pan.  Prick the bottom of the tart shells all over with a fork.  Chill the tart shells for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 325F.  Lightly butter two pieces of aluminum foil large enough to generously line each tart pan.  Line the tart shells with the foil, buttered side down and fill with dried beans, rice or pie weights.

Bake the tart shells for 15 minutes.  Remove the foil and beans and continue baking for 8-10 minutes longer, until evenly golden brown.  Cool completely on a wire rack.

Tamarind Juice

INGREDIENTS:

- Comlressed Block of Tamarind


METHOD:

Break off a chunk of tamarind.  Pour hot water over and allow to sit for 15-20 minutes until soft.

When cool, massage the tamarind to release the pulp.  Allow to sit another 15 minutes for juice to thicken.  Place in glass jar and refrigerate until needed.  As you use the juice, replace the amount you have removed with water.  It will start out thick and become thinner.  About the time it is as thin as buttermilk, it is time to make a new batch.

Tangerine Glazed Ham

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Ingredients
1 (8 to 10-pound) smoked ham, bone-in, skin on
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 bunch fresh sage leaves
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut in chunks
2 tangerines, sliced thin, seeds removed
2 cups tangerine juice
2 cups light brown sugar, packed
1 cup water
1/4 teaspoon whole cloves
2 cinnamon sticks
11/2 pounds carrots, peeled
Directions
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Put the ham in a large roasting pan, fat-side up. Using a sharp knife, score the ham with cuts across the skin, about 2-inches apart and 1/2-inch deep. Cut diagonally down the slashes to form a diamond pattern; season the meat generously with salt and pepper. Chop about 8 of the sage leaves and put it in a bowl; mix with the oil to make a paste. Rub the sage-oil all over the ham, being sure to get the flavor into all the slits. Bake the ham for 2 hours. Now there is plenty of time to bang-out the tangerine glaze.

For the glaze: Place a saucepan over medium heat. Add the chunks of butter, tangerines, tangerine juice, brown sugar, water, and spices. Slowly cook the liquid down to a syrupy glaze; this should take about 30 to 40 minutes.

After the ham has being going for a couple of hours, pour the tangerine glaze all over it, with the pieces of fruit and all. Scatter the remaining sage leaves on top and stick the ham back in the oven and continue to cook for 11/2 hours, basting with the juices every 30 minutes.

Scatter the carrots around the ham and coat in the tangerine glaze. Stick the ham once again back in the oven and cook for a final 30 minutes, until the carrots are tender, the ham is dark and crispy, and the whole thing is glistening with a sugary glaze.

Set the ham on a cutting board to rest before carving. Serve the carrots and tangerine glaze on the side.SOURCE: Adapted from Tyler Florence

Remove the ribs from the marinade and reserve the marinade.  Shake off the excess marinade and place the ribs on a rack in a shallow roasting pan.  Put the pan in the top third of the oven and roast for 45 minutes to 1 hour, basting the ribs from time to time with the reserved marinade.  The ribs are done when they begin to pull away from the bone and the bone tips  are exposed.  The internal temperature tof the thickest part should be 155F-165F.

Meanwhile, make the Thai Dipping Sauce:  Combine the ingredients in a bowl and stir until the sugar is dissolved.

Allow the ribs to rest for 5-10 minutes after removing from oven and cut into individual ribs.  Enjoy with sauce!

Three Layer Chocolate Cake with Blackout Filling

INGREDIENTS:



METHOD:

Three-Layer Chocolate Cake with Blackout Filling
Created by Naomi Josepher & Jon Payson

 
Naomi Josepher and Jon Payson, co-owners of the Brooklyn dessert café the Chocolate Room, serve their cake with a glass of Bonny Doon Framboise, a liqueur made from raspberries.

Ingredients:Makes 1 three-layer 9-inch cake

Filling:

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 teaspoon corn syrup
2/3 cup cocoa powder , sifted
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons butter , softened
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Frosting:

13 tablespoons (1 stick plus 5 tablespoons) butter
6 ounces semisweet chocolate (60 percent)
3 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate
3/4 cup granulated sugar
Pinch salt
5 large eggs
Cake:

16 tablespoons (2 sticks) butter , softened
3 cups firmly packed dark brown sugar
4 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup cocoa powder , sifted
1 tablespoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups cake flour (not self-rising)
1 1/2 cups sour cream
1 1/2 cups hot water
To make filling: In a small saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, cocoa powder, and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally to prevent scorching. Meanwhile, in a separate small bowl, combine cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water. Remove boiling cocoa mixture from heat; whisk in cornstarch mixture.

Return saucepan to heat, and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. Boil about 1 minute, until cornstarch is cooked and mixture is very thick.

Remove from heat. Stir in butter and vanilla. Pour into a shallow, heat-resistant bowl; immediately cover surface with plastic wrap to prevent film from forming. Cool completely, and refrigerate until firm, or overnight.

To make frosting: In a large glass bowl, combine butter and chocolates; heat in microwave (or on stovetop in a double boiler) until melted. Stir until thoroughly combined.

In a separate bowl, combine sugar and salt. In a medium saucepan, thoroughly whisk eggs; whisk in sugar mixture, combining thoroughly. Whisk in a scant 1/2 cup water, combining thoroughly; place over medium heat and bring to 160° on a candy thermometer, whisking constantly to prevent sticking, but creating as little foam as possible.

Strain mixture through fine sieve into heat-resistant container. Whisk into chocolate mixture until thoroughly combined. Cool completely, then refrigerate until stiff enough to spread, or overnight.

To make cake: Preheat oven to 350°. Grease three 9-inch round cake pans with butter; line bottoms with parchment paper, and butter the paper.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream together butter and brown sugar on medium speed, about 5 minutes. In a separate bowl, combine eggs and vanilla; add to brown sugar mixture in two batches, mixing on medium speed until incorporated. Scrape bowl thoroughly; beat 1 minute on high speed.

Sift together cocoa powder, baking soda and salt; add to brown sugar mixture and beat on low speed until just combined.

Sift flour. Add 1 cup to batter and beat on low speed until just combined. Add 3/4 cup sour cream to batter; beat on low speed until just combined. Alternate adding flour and sour cream to batter until there's none left. With mixer still running on low, slowly add hot water, beating until just combined.

Scrape bowl thoroughly; beat batter on low speed about 20 seconds. Scrape bowl thoroughly once more, then divide batter evenly among the three pans, about 3 cups per pan. Bake 30 to 33 minutes, or until cake pulls away from sides of pan. Remove from oven. Cool layers in pans about 30 minutes, then remove from pans and cool completely on wire racks. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to one night before assembling.

To assemble, level cake layers by slicing off their tops. Place bottom layer on a serving platter cut side up. Spread 1/2 cup filling on top. Place middle layer cut side down on top of bottom layer. Spread remaining filling on top. Place top layer cut side down on top of middle layer. Spread top and sides of cake with frosting.

Three-Color Poached Pears

INGREDIENTS:

- 12 cups water
- 3 cups sugar
- 2 cups white wine
- 1/2 vanilla bean, split lenghwise
- 1/4 cup grenadine
- 1/2 lemon grated zest
- 1/2 lemon juice
- 3 cups fruity red wine
- 1/2 orange grated zest
- 1/2 orange juice
- 6 ripe Barlett or Bosc pears


METHOD:

Arrange 3 saucepans on the stove.  In one, combine 4 cups water, 1 cup of the sugar, the white wine, and the vanilla bean.  In the next, combine 5 cups water, 1 cups of the sugar the grenadine, lemon zest and lemon juice.  In the last, combine 3 cups water, the remaining 1 cup of sugar, the red wine, orange zest and the orange juice.  Bring them al to a simmer over medium=low heat, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, peel the pears and cut them in half from top to bottom.  Using a melon baller, scoop out the seed pocket.  Using a small knife, cut a shallow V down the center of the bear's cut face to remove the stem, strings and bud end.

Cut out 3 circles of wax paper the same size as the saucepans.  Place 4 pear halves in each saucepan and rest a wax paper circle directly on top of the pears.  Bring to a gentle simmer and simmer without stirring until tender, about 15 minutes.  When the pears can be pierced easily with a fork, they are done.  Turn off the heat and let cool in the liquid.  Serve at room temperature. (Or refrigerate in the liquid overnight to let the pears absorb even more color and flavor:  bring to room temperature before serving.  

To serve, arrange one pear half of each color in a spoke pattern on a white plate.  Drizzle a spoonful of the grenadine 
poaching liquid over the pears and serve.

Tomatillo-Green Guacamole

INGREDIENTS:

- For 1 Cup Essential Roasted
- Tomatillo-Serrano Salsa:
- 6 medium tomatillos, husked & rinsed
- 2 serrano chiles
- 1 large clove garlic, unpeeled
- 1/2 small white onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup cilantro, roughly chopped


METHOD:

4              large  avocados -- ripe
  1           teaspoon  salt -- or to taste

Salsa:  Lay the tomatillos on a baking sheet and place 4 inches below a very hot broiler.  When the tomatillos blister, blacken and soften on one side, about 5 minutes, turn them over and roast the other side.  Cool.

Roast the chiles and garlic on an ungreased comal or cast iron skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until blackened in spots and soft, 5-10 minutes for the chiles, about 15 minutes for the garlic.  Cool, then pull the stems from the chiles and peel the garlic.

Combine the tomatillos, chiles and garlic in a food processor or blender.  Process to a coarse puree.  Transfer to a medium side bowl.  Scoop the onion into a strainer, rinse under cold water, shake off the excess and stir into the tomatillo mixture along with the cilantro.

Finishing the Guacamole:  Cut the avocados in half, running your knife around the pit from stem to blossom end and back up again, twist the halves in opposite directions to free the pits and pull the halves apart.  Scoop out the pits.  With a soup spoon, scoop out the avocado flesh.  Place in a medium-size bowl.

Mash the avocados with a large fork or potato masher.  Stir in the salsa, then taste and season with salt.  Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface of the guacamole.

Advance Preparation:  The salsa can be made 2 days ahead, but don't add onion and cilantro until using.  Finished guacamole keeps, covered and refrigerated, up to 5 hours.

Tomato-Jalapeno Sauce (Salsa de Jitomate Cocida)

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 lb. tomatoes, generous pound
- 2 fresh jalapeno chiles, stemmed
- 1 tablespoon corn oil, (or lard)
- 1/2 small white onion
- 1 1/2 cups chicken broth
- salt to taste


METHOD:

Roast the tomatoes and chiles on a bking sheet 4 inches below a very hot broiler until blistered and blackened on 1 side, about 6 minutes, then use tongs or a spoon to turn them over and roast the other side.  Cool, then peel the tomatoes, collecting all the juices.  Roughly chop the ciles.  Coarsely puree the tomatoes with juices and the chiles in a food processor or blender.  Pulse the mixture only a few times leaving it quite chunky for huevos rancheros, for instance, or run the machine until the sauce is quite smooth if you're preparing, say enchiladas.`

In a medium deep, heavy skillet or medium-size (2-3 quart) saucepan heat the oil or lard over medium.  Add the onion and fry until browned, about 10 minutes.  Increase the heat to medium-high, and, when very hot, add the tomato-chile mixture.  Stir for 5 minutes or so as the mixture sizzles, darkens and thickens, then redue the heat to medium-low, stir in the broth and let the sauce cook at a gentle simmer for about 15 minutes, until beginning to thicken (though it shouldn't be as thick as spaghetti sauce).  Taste and season with salt and it's ready to use.

Traditional Chile Rellenos

INGREDIENTS:

- 12 chiles, California or pablano
- 1 lb. jack cheese or Mexican tofu cheese, sliced 1/8" x 1" x 1 1/2" (approx.)
- 10 large eggs
- 10 tablespoons flour
- salt, to taste
- 2 cups chicken or beef stock
- 2 cups chopped tomatoes
- 1 large onion, sliced
- handful Mexican oregano
- salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/2-1 cup fresh salsa
- corn or canola oil


METHOD:

Blacken chiles over open fire, grill or under broiler and sweat in bowl covered with plastic wrap until cool enough to handle. Peel, keeping whole and removing seeds where possible without tearing too much.  Lay out on sheet pan lined with parchment paper.  Cut each chile in half, length wise.

Fill each piece with 1-2 pieces of jack cheese or smooth with Mexican Tofu Cheese down one side.  Fold over.  Place on parchment lined sheet pan.  

Meanwhile, place stock in pan and add tomatoes, onions and season with oregano, salt and allow to simmer gently.

Make batter by separating egg yolks from egg whites.  Beat whites until stiff.  Beat egg yolks until light yellow.  Then alternately fold in egg yolks and flour in fourths folding after each addition of both until all in incorporated.  Should still be fluffy.

Heat oil to a depth of about 1/4" in large saute pan.  Dip stuffed chiles into batter and gently lay in hot oil, leaving plenty of room around chiles to turn.  Complete this process with each chile and after browning on each side, remove to paper towels to absorb some of the oil.

When you are finished with the chiles, place them gently in one layer in a large ovenproof pan.  Keep hot in a 200F oven.

Finish the sauce with the fresh salsa to taste.

Serve the rellenos with the sauce and sour cream if desired.

Triple Caramel Cake

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 cups heavy cream
- 2 1/2 cups sugar
- 1 1/2 sticks butter, at room temperature
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 cups unbleached flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- pinch salt


METHOD:

Slowly bring 2 cups of the cream to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Reduce the heat and keep at a bare simmer.

Put 1 cups of the sugar in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Leave undisturbed until the sugar begins to melt and darken.  Gently shake the pan to distribute the sugar and to keep it from burning.  When all has melted and the caramel is a very dark amber, remove from the heat.  Carefully add the hot cream, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Don't worry if the caramel hardens; it will melt as the sauce boils.  Return the pan to the heat and keep the sauce at a gentle boil for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Set aside for at least 30 minutes, stirring often, until the sauce is cool.  Measure 1 cup of the caramel to add to the cake batter and refrigerate the rest.

Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325F.  Grease and flour a 12 cup bundt pan.

Cream the butter and remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating until each one is incorporated before adding the next.  Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl.  Gently but thoroughly fold the dry ingredients into the butter mixture alternately with the reserved 1 cup caramel, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 35-40 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack for about 10 inutes and then unmold and cool completely on the rack.  Bring the remaining caramel sauce to room temperature.  When the cake is cool, glaze it by drizzling half of the remaining caramel sauce over the top.

Whip the remaining 1 cup cream until it holds firm peaks.  Fold in the last third of the caramel gently, leaving streaks visible.  Serve with the cake.

Turkey Fazule

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 12-14 pound turkey carcass, add wing tips & a leg or two (of the turkey)
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 large carrots, diced
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- 2 branches fresh thyme , left whole
- 1-2 bay leaves
- water, to cover all
- 1 pound mixed beans, like for "Bean Soup", discard the "flavor packet"
- turkey stock* to cover by 2"
- salt to taste
- 2-3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 large shallot, minced
- 1/3 cup fresh sage, rosemary, thyme leaves, equal amounts of each to equal 1/3 cup total
- 2 large carrots, quartered and sliced
- 2 stalks celery, cut in thirds lengthwise and sliced
- 7 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-2 cups mushrooms, sliced
- 1 16 ounce can of crushed tomatoes
- 2 cups turkey, cut in bite size pieces
- 4-6 cups turkey stock*
- salt & pepper to taste
- 8 ounces small elbow macaroni, cooked, strained, sprinkled with olive oil
- Parmesan cheese, grated


METHOD:

Turkey Stock:  Place all ingredients for the stock in a large stock pot and cover with water by 2".  Bring to a boil, lower to simmer and skim the scum (the dark bubbles that initially come to the top).  Allow to simmer for about 3-4 hours.  Start the beans after you get the turkey stock simmering away.....

Beans:  Pour the beans into a sauce pot and cover with water by 2".  Bring to a boil.  Turn off the heat, cover the pot,  and allow the beans to soak for at least one hour.  Drain the beans and rinse them.  Rinse out the pot.  Place the beans back into the sauce pot and strain some turkey stock that has been cooking over the beans to cover by 2".  Bring to a boil; turn down to a simmer and cook until beans are cooked through, testing by tasting a couple of beans every 45 minutes or so.  Add a little salt to taste when they are about half cooked through.  Cook until cooked through, but still slightly chewy.  When they are cooked through, they are ready to use in the soup.  Just turn off the fire and let them sit there looking happy and ready.

Back to Stock:  After 3-4 hours, pull out the large chunks of carcass and increase the heat under the stock to a low boil, allowing the stock to reduce to enrich it and make it taste even better!!  Just keep it at a low boil for up to an hour or until you are ready to make the soup....it's ready, you can use it at any point.  Don't let it go any longer than 45 minutes to an hour.  

Soup:  Heat a large soup pot over medium heat.  Add olive oil, shallot, herbs.  Cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes, being careful not to burn the shallot.  Add the carrots and celery and cook about  3-4 minutes adding a bit of salt and pepper.   Add the minced garlic and cook another 1-2 minutes being careful not to burn the garlic.  Add the mushrooms and cook briefly, about 5 minutes, allowing the mushrooms to take in the flavors in the pot.  With a slotted spoon, spoon the beans over the top of all the vegetables in the pot.  Use all the beans and discard the dark bean water.  Add the turkey and tomatoes.  Hold a strainer over the soup pot and pour enough stock into the pot to cover adequately (usually almost to the top in my 6 quart pot).  Salt and pepper to taste.

Cook the pasta.  Strain and drizzle with olive oil to keep it from sticking to itself.  Do not put it in the pot or it will become big and too soft.  Keep it in a separate bowl and place a couple of tablespoons of pasta in the bottom of the bowl before pouring the soup on top.  Top with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.

If you have any stock left, strain the rest of it and place into freezer containers.  It is wonderful and can be used in any recipe that calls for chicken stock.  Consider it "liquid gold"!

*Turkey Stock/Beans - This soup can be made by using chicken stock instead of turkey stock.  Also, if you want to use canned beans (strain and rinse first),  put them in in the last 10 minutes before serving.

Vanilla Bean Ice Cream

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup half & half
- 2 cups whipping cream
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 vanilla bean, scraped of beans; added to cream
- 6 large egg yolks


METHOD:

Place half & half, and sugar with vanilla bean and scrapping of seeds in a small sauce pot.  Heat until sugar is dissolved.  Turn off heat and allow the vanilla bean to infuse the mixture for at least 10 minutes up to a half hour.  Return the heat to simmer. 

Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks briefly, just to mix.  When the cream mixture comes to a simmer, pour half of the cream mixture into the egg yolks, whisking while you do this process.  (This is called "tempering the eggs", so they will not scramble).

Return the egg and cream mixture to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, until the  mixture coats the back of the spoon.  (Your finger drawn across the back of the spoon through the mixture will leave a clear, non-dripping, trail).

Strain the mixture into a metal bowl.  Add the 2 cups of  whipping cream.  Place this bowl inside a large bowl with water and ice to cool the mixture.  Cover and place in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.

Freeze the mixture to the "ice cream" state with your ice cream maker, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Vegetable Mousse

INGREDIENTS:

- 6 carrots, cut in fourths
- 3 acorn squash
- 3 celery root
- 12 ounces binder (gelatin in finished liq. form)
- Note: 1 cup comm. gelatin powder
- dissolved in 1 gallon of water, heat
- to 110F in double boiler, no higher
- than 114F.
- 3 pints aeration or 3 cups whipping cream, whipped


METHOD:

Cook the carrots in water with a little salt until mushy, ~ 1 hour.

Cook the whole acorn squash in hot oven until blackened and very soft, ~1 1/2 hour.

Cook the whole peeled celery root in lemon water until mushy, ~ 1-1 1/2 hour.

Let cooked products cool until easy to touch, ~ 1 hour.  Mash each product separately and push through  a screen and should end up the consistency of "runny mashed potatoes". 

Measure out 2 cups each of the mashed vegetable product in separate bowls.  Season each product base, taking into consideration the addition of aeration that will double the base, decreasing the taste of seasoning.

Add 4 oz. of dissolved gelatin to each product, followed by folding in 2 cups of whipped cream...one product at a time.  With each completed vegetable mousse, layer into lined mousse mold.  Its pretty to begin with the celery root on bottom, followed by squash, topped with carrot.  Refrigerate overnight.

Very Old-Fashioned Country Chicken Pie

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 large chicken, 6-7#
- flour, salt, freshly ground pepper and
- paprika
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons lard
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 2 carrots, cut in quarters
- boiling water
- 2 stalks celery, cut in thin slices

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup half and half
- liver of the chicken, chopped
- 2 recipes bate brisee
- 1 egg yolk, blended with 1 tablespoon cream


METHOD:

Combine the flour, s/p and paprika in a heavy sack.  Add the chicken pieces and shake well.  Heat the butter and other fat in a heavy deep skillet or braising pan and brown the pieces of chicken well over rather brisk heat.  When nicely browned and crusty add the onion, carrots and enough boiling water to just barely cover the chicken.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to a faint simmer.  Cook the chicken till just tender -- do not overcook.  Transfer the chicken pieces to a large baking dish that will hold the chicken and sauce.  

Add the celery and small white onions to the broth and cook gently till just tender.  Transfer the vegetables to the baking dish.

Combine the butter and flour in a small saucepan and when bubbling and cooked slightly, stir in the cream and continue to stir till thickened.  Skim excess fat from the chicken broth and stir the cream sauce into the broh.  Pour enough over the chicken pieces to cover well.  Cool thoroughly.

Roll out pastry to fit the top of the baking dish and allow for overlap -- about 1 1/2 ".  Place the pastry over the dish, secure the edges, and crimp with the tines of a fork.  Brush the pastry with the egg-cream mixture.  Cut a vent in the ceneter for steam to escape.  Bake at 450F degrees 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue baking another 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden and crisp.

Vietnamese Summer Rolls (Goi Cuon)

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 ounces rice vermicelli
- 4 ounces pork tenderloin
- 18 small shrimp
- 12 round rice papers, 8" diameter
- 1 head Boston lettuce
- 24 large mint leaves
- 1 cup carrots, julienned


METHOD:

When cool enough to handle, divide the vermicelli into 12 equal portions.  In the same boiling water, cook the pork tenderloin until cooked through, about 10 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, thinly slice the pork.  In the same water, cook the shrimp until they turn opaque about 1 minute.  When cool enough to handle, cut in half lengthwise and devein.

Pour lukewarm water about 1 inch deep into a square or rectangular dish.  Separate and soak 4 wrappers at a time until pliable about 5 minutes.  Place a clean kitchen towel on your work surface, then place each rice paper on the towel.  With another kitchen towel, gently blot each wrapper until it is no longer wet but remains sticky.  Leaving 1 inch uncovered on the side closest to you and the adjacent sides, place a lettuce leaf, vermicelli portion on top, 3 shrimp halves (overlapped), 2 pork slices (overlapped), 2 mint leaves, and some carrot on each rice paper.  Fold wrapper once over the filling, then fold in the sides, and continue rolling tightly to the end.  Repeat this process with the remaining ingredients to make 12 rolls.  Wrap in a damp towel or with plastic wrap until ready to eat.  Serve with peanut sauce.

METHOD:

Wash and spin dry greens and radicchio.  Layer in large bowl between paper towels.  Place in refrigerator for at least 20 minutes to crisp. Roast the pinenuts in a 375F oven for about 6-8 minutes.  Watch carefully; they burn easily.  They are done when golden.

Place the thinly sliced red onion in the red wine vinegar and put aside while you proceed.

Place the shallots and garlic in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a saute pan.  Soften.  Add the balsamic vinegar and reduce by at least 1/3.  Add the 
1 tablespoon of brown sugar and dissolve.  Turn the stove off and remove pan for a moment.  Add olive oil, carefully, a little at a time, whisking.  When you get about 1/2 cup into the vinegar, taste for balance.  Add more if needed.  Continue, again, to warm slowly.  Do not boil.  Season with 
salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, go back to the salad and add the onions (not the vinegar) to the salad.  Top the salad with the warm viniagrette and serve immediately.

Yorkshire Pudding

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 cups AP flour
- 5 large eggs, separate out yolks
- salt
- ground pepper
- 2 1/2 - 3 cups skim milk
- 1 tablespoon fat from roast


METHOD:

Begin making the yorkshire pudding as soon as you place the rib roast in the oven.

Sift the flour into a bowl.  Add egg yolks, seasonings and 1/3 of the milk.  Stir with a wooden spoon until smooth and then gradually add the remaining milk.

Cover.

When the temperature of the meat is at about 100F, whip the egg whites until a soft point can be made.  Gradually fold in the above batter into the egg whites.  Allow to rest until the roast is pulled out at 115F or 120F.

Pour off fat from roasting pan.  Reserve 1 tablespoons of it.  Pour about 1 cup of beef stock into the pan and deglaze the pan.  Strain this mixture and reserve it.  Do not wash the pan. Add the reserved fat and 2 tablespoons of the deglazed, strained mixture back into the roasting pan, spreading the mixture over the bottom of the pan.   Beat the pudding mixture to rehomogenize it and pour into the roasting pan.  Bake at 400F about 15 minutes until puffed up and then reduce the temperature to 350F and bake until golden and crisp for another 8-10 minutes.

During the time that the pudding cooks is the time you are allowing the rib roast to rest, covered, and you can continue with your reduction sauce.
